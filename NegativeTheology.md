In _Guide for the Perplexed_, Maimonides makes very strong statements regarding Negative Theology. The gist of his argument is this: no positive statements can be made about God, only negative ones. This is an important plank in his stance that God does not have any essential attributes; i.e., God is a uniate substance, simple and devoid of any multiplicity. For Maimonides, this 'lack of multiplicity' implies that God must not have any attributes.

If he cannot have any attributes, then how are we to understand the usual statements that are made about God, such as, e.g., that he is Living, Wise, and Powerful? For Maimonides, these three 'attributes' are
1. used homonymously for God, such that when we say God is 'wise', we mean something very different compared to what we mean when we say that a person is wise.
2. not to be understood in a positive sense at all! 

A paradigmatic example for (2) is how Maimonides explains the expression 'Living' when used for God. According to him, this being is not like the four elements of sublunary matter (earth, air, fire, water); “we therefore say that it is living, expressing thereby that it is not dead”.

Thus, when we say that God is living, what we are _really_ saying (according to Maimonides) is that God is not dead. But this is a very strange statement to make, because either way it seems that we have made _some_ positive statement about God. So Maimonides' argument seems, at first glance, to be more sophistry with words: he has replaced one positive statement about God, (A) 'that he is living' with a different positive statement, (A') 'that he is not dead'. He is very serious about the deep chasm that exists between asserting A and A' about God. 

Asserting A' is one step in the journey toward a true knowledge of God as he is, for he says in [GP I.59](/summaries/I/ch59/), "by each additional negative attribute you advance toward the knowledge of God, and you are nearer to it than he who does not negative [that attribute]".

However, asserting A puts one in grave error. If we truly assert A, we begin to believe in an attribute-full God, and for Maimonides, "he who affirms attributes of God ... unconsciously loses his belief in God" ([GP I.60](/summaries/I/ch60/)).

To a casual reader, however, it is very difficult to understand why Maimonides thinks A and A' are so different from each other. Doesn't one directly imply the other? Aren't the two simply two different ways in which we can express exactly the same thought?
