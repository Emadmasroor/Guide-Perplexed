In _Guide for the Perplexed_, Maimonides makes very strong statements regarding Negative Theology. The gist of his argument is this: no positive statements can be made about God, only negative ones. This is an important plank in his stance that God does not have any essential attributes; i.e., God is a uniate substance, simple and devoid of any multiplicity. For Maimonides, this 'lack of multiplicity' implies that God must not have any attributes.

If he cannot have any attributes, then how are we to understand the usual statements that are made about God, such as, e.g., that he is Living, Wise, and Powerful? For Maimonides, these three 'attributes' are
1. used homonymously for God, such that when we say God is 'wise', we mean something very different compared to what we mean when we say that a person is wise.
2. not to be understood in a positive sense at all! 

A paradigmatic example for (2) is how Maimonides explains the expression 'Living' when used for God. According to him, this being is not like the four elements of sublunary matter (earth, air, fire, water); “we therefore say that it is living, expressing thereby that it is not dead”.

Thus, when we say that God is living, what we are _really_ saying (according to Maimonides) is that God is not dead. But this is a very strange statement to make, because either way it seems that we have made _some_ positive statement about God. So Maimonides' argument seems, at first glance, to be more sophistry with words: he has replaced one positive statement about God, (A) 'that he is living' with a different positive statement, (A') 'that he is not dead'. He is very serious about the deep chasm that exists between asserting A and A' about God. 

Asserting A' is one step in the journey toward a true knowledge of God as he is, for he says in [GP I.59](/summaries/I/ch59/), "by each additional negative attribute you advance toward the knowledge of God, and you are nearer to it than he who does not negative [that attribute]".

However, asserting A puts one in grave error. If we truly assert A, we begin to believe in an attribute-full God, and for Maimonides, "he who affirms attributes of God ... unconsciously loses his belief in God" ([GP I.60](/summaries/I/ch60/)).

To a casual reader, however, it is very difficult to understand why Maimonides thinks A and A' are so different from each other. Doesn't one directly imply the other? Aren't the two simply two different ways in which we can express exactly the same thought?

The answer to this, and the key to understand Maimonides' intent, might lie in the distinction between **necessary** statements and **sufficient** statements. In mathematics, one can make two types of statements regarding an idea. If C is a necessary condition for Z, then C **must** be true for Z to be true. However, since C is only _necessary_ but not _sufficient_, Z need not be true if C is true. If we have a necessary condition for Z, we can never be quite sure that we grasp Z because Z may or may not be true, no matter how many sufficient conditions we are aware of and can verify. If we are aware of one necessary condition for Z, i.e., C, then we have _some_ knowledge of Z but not absolute knowledge. We can check C to determine if Z is true or not. If C is true, then Z _may_ be true; if C is false, then Z _cannot_ be true. 

Suppose we now learn of another necessary condition for Z, D. Then again, we have gained another piece of knowledge about Z, i.e., that D must be true for Z to be true. This _is_ some knowledge, but it is not 'positive' knowledge; it is a kind of 'negative' knowledge. It circumscribes the possible things that Z can be. It does not really tell us what Z is, only what Z is not. It tells us that if D is false, then Z cannot be true. However, if D is true, then the field is wide open --- we have come nowhere close to proving that Z is true.

If we think of each successive negative attribute as a kind of 'necessary statement' about God, we can begin to make more sense of what Maimonides means. He says that "there is no possibility of obtaining a knolwedge of the true essence of God ... and the only thing that man can apprehend of Him is the fact that He exists, and that all positive attributes are inadmissible". We can interpret this statement to mean that no **sufficient** statements can ever be made of God. Instead, all that we have are a succession of **necessary** statements, each of which circumscribes God and tells us with definitiveness (i.e., with a _positive_ knowledge) what God is not, while only 'pointing the way', albeit indirectly, toward what God _is_. No _positive_ knowledge about the essence of God is gained by each additional 'negative attribute', but we can still justly say that these do put us on a path toward true knowledge of God.

If we think of the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,...} and based on our knowledge of this set, we try to define the largest natural number, we run into a similar situation. Let us denote by ∞ something like 'the largest natural number'. What we can we positively assert about ∞? We can make the following necessary statement:

∞ > 10

i.e., we can be quite certain that the number we seek, ∞, is larger than 10. But this is only a necessary statement. This is a statement that confirms to us what ∞ is not; it is not 1,2,3,...,9,10. But what **is** it? Is it 11? No. Is it 12? No. In one sense, once we state that ∞ > 10, we circumscribe the possibility to some extent (we can rule out ten numbers), but once we do so we find that we are still no closer to finding out what ∞ _really_ is. This state of affairs exists because we do not have access to any _sufficient_ statements about ∞, but only necessary ones. We may be able to circumscribe ∞ further if we make a subsequent necessary statement about ∞, i.e.,

∞ > 20

and we now know more about ∞ than the person who did not assert this necessary statement. In that sense we have come closer to a knowledge of ∞ than we had before. But in another sense, we have really not come any closer to defining what ∞ **is**, because we don't have any sufficient statements about it.
