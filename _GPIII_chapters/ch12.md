In this chapter, Maimonides undertakes to refute the commonly-held notion (خيال الجمهور, _khayal al-jamhoor_) that "evils in the world are more numerous than the good things". The word he uses for evil is _sharr_ شر and for good, _khayr_ خير. He is, at the outset, very critical of this point of view , to the point of scornfulness, and castigates Al-Razi for his book on Metaphysics which, according to Maimonides, makes the same claim. I assume this is regarding [Abu Bakr al-Razi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr_al-Razi) and not [Fakhr al-Din al-Razi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi).

Maimonides says that people fall into this error because they
> judge the whole universe by examining one single person. For an ignorant man believes that the whole universe only exists for him; as if nothing else required any consideration. If, therefore, anything happens to him contrary to his expectation, he at once concludes that the whole universe is evil. If, however, he would take into consideration the whole universe, form an idea of it, and comprehend what a small portion he is of the Universe, he will find the truth. For it is clear that persons who have fallen into this widespread error as regards the multitude of evils in the world, do not find the evils among the angels, the spheres and stars, the elements, and that which is formed of them, viz., minerals and plants, or in the various species of living beings, but only in some individual instances of mankind.

He paints a rather petulant picture of those who complain that the world is more evil than it is good; he gives the example of someone who "became leprous in consequence of bad food", or "was struck with blindndess" because he "indulges so much in sensuality". These arguments seem to be leading toward the sort of resolution to the problem of evil which blames people for their own misfortunes. But before addressing the problem of evil head-on, Maimonides reminds the reader that "the whole mankind at present in existence, and a fortiori, every other species of animals, form an infinitesimal portion of the permanent universe", and that we cannot complain about the entire universe being full of evil simply based on human experience. "It is of great advantage that man should know his station, and not erroneously imagine that the whole universe exists only for him. We hold that the universe exists because the Createor wills it so", and not for our benefit.

Doubling down on the idea that God is good, and is not responsible for any evil, Maimonides says:
> Man’s existence is nevertheless a great boon to him, and his distinction and perfection is a divine gift. The numerous evils to which individual persons are exposed are due to the defects existing in the persons themselves. We complain and seek relief from our own faults: we suffer from the evils which we, by our own free will, inflict on ourselves and ascribe them to God, who is far from being connected with them!
