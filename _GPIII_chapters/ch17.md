There are five theories about Divine Providence (_al-'inayat_ العناية):

1. **Epicurus**' position: There is no providence; everything is governed by chance.
2. **Aristotle**'s opinion: God's providence extends to the realm of the heavenly spheres, but the sublunary world is subject to chance. Those things that have permanence are subject to providence; those that are transitory are not. Hence, the _species_ of any particular organism is subject to Providence and consequently has permanence, but _individuals_ are subject to chance. There is an 'order' to nature that guarantees that, e.g., all the individuals of a species will have the material resources they need in order to grow and flourish; but chance dictates that sometimes, some individuals are harmed 'randomly'; Providence does not govern individuals. 
3. The **Ashari** position: No part of the Universe is subject to chance; everything, large or small, happens by God's will, intention and plan (_irada, qasd, tadbeer_ بإرادة و قصد و تدبير)
4. The **Mutazilite** position:
5. The **Mosaic** position:

According to Maimonides, Aristotle's point of view 
> is closely connected with his theory of the Eternity, of the Universe, and with his opinion that everything different from the existing order of things in Nature is impossible. It is the belief of those who turned away from our Law, and said: “God hath forsaken the earth” ([Ezekiel 9.9](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.9.9)).

The Ashari point of view contains 'evident absurdities'; for one thing, it denies the role of causality in our world by positing God as the direct actor whenever any putatively natural act occurs. Nothing can then be merely possible; everything is either necessay or impossible. It also leads to a fatalism that denies agency to human beings by reducing all of their actions and intentions to the actions and intentions of God. It then follows that Divine commandments to humans are meaningless, since everything as pre-ordained by God anyway. Any evil in the world turns out to be a direct result of God's actions. He completes the rather poor picture he is painting of the Ashari position by saying:
> When we see a person born blind or leprous, who could not have merited a punishment for previous sins, they say, It is the will of God; when a pious worshipper is tortured and slain, it is likewise the will of God; and no injustice can be asserted to Him for that, for according to their opinion it is proper that God should afflict the innocent and do good to the sinner.
