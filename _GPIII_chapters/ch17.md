There are five theories about Divine Providence (_al-'inayat_ العناية):

1. **Epicurus**' position: There is no providence; everything is governed by chance.
2. **Aristotle**'s opinion: God's providence extends to the realm of the heavenly spheres, but the sublunary world is subject to chance. Those things that have permanence are subject to providence; those that are transitory are not. Hence, the _species_ of any particular organism is subject to Providence and consequently has permanence, but _individuals_ are subject to chance. There is an 'order' to nature that guarantees that, e.g., all the individuals of a species will have the material resources they need in order to grow and flourish; but chance dictates that sometimes, some individuals are harmed 'randomly'; Providence does not govern individuals. 
3. The **Ashari** position:
4. The **Mutazilite** position:
5. The **Mosaic** position:

According to Maimonides, Aristotle's point of view 
> is closely connected with his theory of the Eternity, of the Universe, and with his opinion that everything different from the existing order of things in Nature is impossible. It is the belief of those who turned away from our Law, and said: “God hath forsaken the earth” ([Ezekiel 9.9](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.9.9)).
