In this chapter, Maimonides sets down his theory about one of the standard problems of classical Islamic philosophy: _God's Knowledge of Particulars_. This is a subset of the more general problem knows as 'The Problem of Evil', and boils down to the question: If God is good, capable of disposing of all the world's affairs, and knows all things, how does evil exist in the world?

One of the classical answers to this problem, held by some of the esteemed Islamicate philosophers of the time, went as follows: 'God knows universals, not particulars.' This answer to the question is anathema for Maimonides. "Some thinkers assume, ..., haughtily and exultingly, that God knows certain things and is ignorant of certain other things. They did so because they imagined that they discovered a certain absence of order in manâ€™s affairs".

The language used here, "they imagined that they discovered ..." suggests that Maimonides rejects the very premise of this line of argument; he does not believe that there is truly 'an absence of order in man's affairs'. He cites the Books of the Prophets to show that these objections against the Omnipotence and Omniscience of God are not new, and that the Tanakh offers what --- at least for Maimonides --- is a satisfactory answer to this problem.
