These two chapters form a commentary on the [Book of Job](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.1.1), described by Maimonides as a 'strange and wonderful' (الغريبه العجيبه) story which he beleives to be fictional. Maimonides is compelled to put pen to paper because the story of Job represents a common source of perplexity to all thinkers, i.e. the phenomenon that "a simple and perfect person, who is upright in his actions, and very anxious to abstain from sin, is afflicted by successive misfortunes". In answer to these 'perplexities', the Book of Job "includes profound ideas and great mysteries, removes great doubts, and reveals the most important truths". Friedlander's translation appears to be somewhat slopppy here, for the Arabic corrsponding to the last two phrases in this quote is "و تبينت به مشكلات العظيمة، و اتضحت منه حقائق لا غاية بعدها".

According to Maimonides, the Book of Job illustrates a (possible) hierarchy of human suffering: 1) destruction of property; 2) loss of children; 3) bodily pain, in order of the likelihood that people can bear each kind of suffering. 
> Some of us deny God, and believe that there is no rule in the Universe, even if only their property is lost. Others retain their faith in the existence of justice and order, even when suffering from loss of property, whereas loss of children is too much affliction for them. Others remain firm in their faith, even with the loss of their children; but there is no one who can patiently bear the pain that reaches his own person: he then murmurs and complains of injustice either in his heart or with his tongue.

Some of Maimonides' observations:

- "Job, as well as his friends, were of opinion that God Himself was the direct agent of what happened, and that the adversary [i.e., Satan] was not the intermediate cause"
- Even though Job is shown to be a _good_ person, he is not described in the story as a _wise_ person; had he been wise, "he would not have any doubt about the cause of his suffering."
- Satan does not have power over the _soul_ of man, whatever other powers he may have.
- He agrees with a certain quotation from the Talmud: " 'The adversary (satan), evil inclination (yeẓer ha-ra’) [translated, ostensibly by Hussein Attai, as _ya'mal al-suu'_ يعمل السوء], and the angel of death, are one and the same being.' ... It has thus been shown to you that one and the same thing is designated by these three different terms, and that actions ascribed to these three are in reality the actions of one and the same agent"
- There is an 'evil inclination' and an inclination toward good in all of us; "the evil inclination we receive at our birth: for “at the door sin croucheth” [Gen. 4:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), as is distinctly said in the Law, “And the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth” [ibid. 8:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.8.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en). The good inclination, however, comes when the mind is developed."


**Commentary** 

Maimonides' confident assertion that the Book of Job is a fictionalized account is in spite of his acknowledgement that some 'Sages' (الحكماء) --- perhaps some of the contributors to the Talmud, i.e., the 'KHaZaL'? --- have believed in the historical existence of Job.
