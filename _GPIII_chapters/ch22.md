These two chapters form a commentary on the [Book of Job](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.1.1), described by Maimonides as a 'strange and wonderful' (الغريبه العجيبه) story which he beleives to be fictional. Maimonides is compelled to put pen to paper because the story of Job represents a common source of perplexity to all thinkers, i.e. the phenomenon that "a simple and perfect person, who is upright in his actions, and very anxious to abstain from sin, is afflicted by successive misfortunes". In answer to these 'perplexities', the Book of Job "includes profound ideas and great mysteries, removes great doubts, and reveals the most important truths". Friedlander's translation appears to be somewhat slopppy here, for the Arabic corrsponding to the last two phrases in this quote is "و تبينت به مشكلات العظيمة، و اتضحت منه حقائق لا غاية بعدها".
