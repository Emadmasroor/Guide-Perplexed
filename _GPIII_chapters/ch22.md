These two chapters form a commentary on the [Book of Job](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.1.1), described by Maimonides as a 'strange and wonderful' (الغريبه العجيبه) story which he beleives to be fictional. Maimonides is compelled to put pen to paper because the story of Job represents a common source of perplexity to all thinkers, i.e. the phenomenon that "a simple and perfect person, who is upright in his actions, and very anxious to abstain from sin, is afflicted by successive misfortunes". In answer to these 'perplexities', the Book of Job "includes profound ideas and great mysteries, removes great doubts, and reveals the most important truths". Friedlander's translation appears to be somewhat slopppy here, for the Arabic corrsponding to the last two phrases in this quote is "و تبينت به مشكلات العظيمة، و اتضحت منه حقائق لا غاية بعدها".

According to Maimonides, the Book of Job illustrates a (possible) hierarchy of human suffering: 1) destruction of property; 2) loss of children; 3) bodily pain, in order of the likelihood that people can bear each kind of suffering. 
> Some of us deny God, and believe that there is no rule in the Universe, even if only their property is lost. Others retain their faith in the existence of justice and order, even when suffering from loss of property, whereas loss of children is too much affliction for them. Others remain firm in their faith, even with the loss of their children; but there is no one who can patiently bear the pain that reaches his own person: he then murmurs and complains of injustice either in his heart or with his tongue.

Some of Maimonides' observations:

- "Job, as well as his friends, were of opinion that God Himself was the direct agent of what happened, and that the adversary [i.e., Satan] was not the intermediate cause"
- Even though Job is shown to be a _good_ person, he is not described in the story as a _wise_ person; had he been wise, "he would not have any doubt about the cause of his suffering."
- Satan does not have power over the _soul_ of man, whatever other powers he may have.
- He agrees with a certain quotation from the Talmud: " 'The adversary (satan), evil inclination (yeẓer ha-ra’) [translated, ostensibly by Hussein Attai, as _ya'mal al-suu'_ يعمل السوء], and the angel of death, are one and the same being.' ... It has thus been shown to you that one and the same thing is designated by these three different terms, and that actions ascribed to these three are in reality the actions of one and the same agent"
- There is an 'evil inclination' and an inclination toward good in all of us; "the evil inclination we receive at our birth: for “at the door sin croucheth” [Gen. 4:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.7), as is distinctly said in the Law, “And the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth” [ibid. 8:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.8.21). The good inclination, however, comes when the mind is developed."

There are some general opinions or principles held to be true by Job as well as his friends, e.g., the idea that when a wicked person is in prosperity, one expects an impending change, and similarly, when a good person suffers, one expects to see the situation change, presumably according to the justice of God. Essentially, Job's friends are convinced that "those who act well receive reward, and those who act wickedly are punished. When a wicked and rebellious person is seen in prosperity, it may be assumed for certain that a change will take place; he will die, or troubles will afflict him and his house. When we find a worshipper of God in misfortune, we may be certain that God will heal the stroke of his wound." It is not at all clear whether Maimonides himself believes this statement. Nevertheless, Maimonides recognizes that the underlying question is an important one, i.e., why do bad things happen to good people?

One possible response to seeing bad things happen to good people, says Maimonides, is Job's (let us say naive, but entirely reasonable) poetic exclamation in [Job IX 22-24](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.9.22), [XXI 23-26](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.21.23) and others that good and evil seem to be equal before God, that affliction comes to both, that God does not care either way and has abandoned his creation. Maimonides tells us that the Sages of the Talmud have condemned Job for his blasphemous statements. However, he then proceeds to tell us that Job holds the above views _at first_:

> It is the opinion which suggests itself as plausible at first thought, especially in the minds of those who meet with mishaps, well knowing that they have not merited them through sins. This is admitted by all, and therefore this opinion was assigned to Job. But he is represented to hold this view only so long as he was without wisdom, and knew God only by tradition, in the same manner as religious people generally know Him. As soon as he had acquired a true knowledge of God, he confessed that there is undoubtedly true felicity in the knowledge of God; it is attained by all who acquire that knowledge, and no earthly trouble can disturb it. So long as Job’s knowledge of God was based on tradition and communication, and not on research, he believed that such imaginary good as is possessed in health, riches, and children, was the utmost that men can attain: this was the reason why he was in perplexity, and why he uttered the above-mentioned opinions, and this is also the meaning of his words: “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent because of dust and ashes” [XLII 5, 6](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.42.5); that is to say he abhorred all that he had desired before, and that he was sorry that he had been in dust and ashes; comp. “and he sat down among the ashes” [II 8](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.2.8). On account of this last utterance, which implies true perception, it is said afterwards in reference to him, “for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.”

What are some of the other opinions described in the Book of Job?



**Commentary** 

Maimonides' confident assertion that the Book of Job is a fictionalized account is in spite of his acknowledgement that some 'Sages' (الحكماء) --- perhaps some of the contributors to the Talmud, i.e., the 'KHaZaL'? --- have believed in the historical existence of Job.

I believe that in this chapter, it is worthwhile to carefully parse Maimonides' own views from the text, because much of the text relates the opinions of the characters in the Book of Job, or the opinions of the Sages of the Talmud, etc.
