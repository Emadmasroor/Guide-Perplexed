Maimonides starts this chapter by proposing a classification of (human) actions.
1. **Purposeless** (_'abas'_ عبث): Actions that are not directed to any purpose, e.g., fiddling with your hands while thinking of something else.
2. **In vain** (_batil_ ﺏﺎﻄﻟ): Actions that do not achieve their purpose, e.g., if you look for something without finding it. 
3. **Unimportant** (_la'b_ ﻞﻌﺑ): Actions that are directed to "an object that is not necessary and is not of great use ... mere pastimes".
4. **Useful** (_jayyid hasan_ جيد حسن): Actions that are "necessary or useful for the purpose which is to be attained". Maimonides uses the word 'good' interchangeably with the word 'useful' here.

All of God's actions, however, must be of the fourth category alone; as [Genesis 1:31](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.31) says, "God saw everything that he had made, and behlod, it was very good." Whatever God has made is necessary and useful for its intended purpose, i.e., the old Aristotelian maxim that nature has made nothing in vain, so that "everything that is not the product of human industry serves a certain purpose, which may be known or unknown to us".
