Maimonides starts this chapter by proposing a classification of (human) actions.
1. **Purposeless** (_'abas'_ عبس): Actions that are not directed to any purpose, e.g., fiddling with your hands while thinking of something else.
2. **In vain**: Actions that do not achieve their purpose, e.g., if you look for something without finding it. 
3. **Unimportant**: Actions that are directed to "an object that is not necessary and is not of great use ... mere pastimes".
4. **Useful**: Actions that are "necessary or useful for the purpose which is to be attained". Maimonides uses the word 'good' interchangeably with the word 'useful' here.

All of God's actions, however, must be of the fourth category alone; as [Genesis 1:31](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.31) says, "God saw everything that he had made, and behlod, it was very good."
