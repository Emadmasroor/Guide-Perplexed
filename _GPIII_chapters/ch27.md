The objectives of the Law (_qasd al-shari'ah_ قصد الشريعة) are twofold: the well-being of the soul and the well-being of the body. By well-being of the soul, Maimonides means something very specific: "correct opinions (_aaraa' sahihah_ آراء صحيحة) according to their capacity". By the well-being of the body, Maimonides means something quite general: not just bodily health, but also social health, i.e., "a proper management of the relations in which we live one to another". Of these two, the well-being of the soul is the more important one, but the conditions for perfecting the well-being of our souls can only be created when the well-being of the body is guaranteed, "for a person that is suffering from great hunger, thirst, heat, or cold, cannot grasp an idea even if communicated by others, much less can he arrive at it by his own reasoning".

The well-being of the body requires proper management of social relations because Maimonides believes, like a good Aristotelian, that man is a social animal (أن الإنسان مدني بالطبع), and his material needs cannot be satisfied by himself alone; he needs society, and society needs laws that prevent us from simply doing what we like.

The well-being of the soul consists in a perfection of knowledge: that man's soul will attain this kind of perfection who knows all that it is possible for humans to know (يعلم كل ما في طاقة الإنسان ) about existent things (_al-mawjudat_ الموجودات). This kind of perfection does not require any good works, good morals, or even actions; it is purely an intellectual good, arrived at through things like speculation (_nazar_ نظر) and research (_bahas_ بحث).

Even though the well-being of the soul is the more important goal, he concedes that most of Scripture is concerned with the secondary goal of the well-being of the body; it is the one that is "most carefully and most minutely" addressed in the Law.

Some more comment on this part: "Secondly, it seeks to train us in faith, and to impart correct and true opinions when the intellect is sufficiently developed"
