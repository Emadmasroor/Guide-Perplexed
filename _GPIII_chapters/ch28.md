In this chapter, Maimonides tells the reader that, as far as "correct opinions" are concerned, the Law only tells us the basics (i.e., to believe in an all-powerful God), but leaves out the details. The basics are "given in the form of final results, but they cannot be understood fully and accurately except after the acquisition of many kinds of knowledge", and Maimonides implies that acquiring these other kinds of knowledge is _also_ a divine commandment. For scriptural support, he states that the commandment to "Love the Lord" ([Deuteronomy 11:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.13)) includes gaining knowledge about "all that exists" and to thereby understand what Maimonides calls God's wisdom.

He also makes a rather cryptic comment about certain other kinds of belief that Scripture prescribes: "Scripture further demands belief in certain truths, the belief in which is indispensable in regulating our social relations: such is the belief that God is angry with those who disobey Him, for it leads us to the fear and dread of disobedience". Does this mean that Maimonides views these beliefs as merely instrumental?
