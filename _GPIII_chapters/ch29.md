In these chapters, Maimonides sets out a spiritual Origin Story for the prophet Abraham, setting his intellectual revolution in the context of the beliefs held by the 'Sabeans' around him. The Sabeans, according to Maimonides, believed in the eternity of the Universe and considered the heavens to be divinities in themselves, with the Sun being the chief diety. The beliefs of the Sabeans, as related by Maimonides, are essentially those of 'primitive religion', or 'paganism', and were broadly identical to those of other 'pagan' peoples that populate(d) the earth; in particular, he mentions "the savage Turks in the extreme North, and the Indians in the extreme South". For Maimonides, the gradual replacement of these primitive belief systems with Abrahamic ones is part of the systematic progression of the human condition, and accords with the Divine prophecy in [Genesis 12:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.3) where God promises to bless those that bless Abraham and curse those who curse him.

It was Abraham who "became convinced that there is a spiritual Divine Being, which is not a body, nor a force residing in a body, but is the author of the spheres and the stars". For Maimonides, this conviction went hand in hand with a rejection of the theory of the Eternity of the Universe and therefore a belief in a created Universe.
