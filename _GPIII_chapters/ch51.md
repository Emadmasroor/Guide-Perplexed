Maimonides begins this chapter with a parable or metaphor -- _mathal_, in which he sets up the following scene:

There is a king (_sultan_), and the king's subjects can be divided into the following categories. Each category seems 'concentric', so that
1. Those who are abroad; the remaining categories are all 'in the country'.
2. Those who have their backs turned toward the king
3. Those who desire nearness to the king, among whom:
4. Some have not yet seen even 'the face of the wall of the house'. Of the remaining,
5. Some who have arrived at the house but are still in search of an entrance,
6. while others have entered and are in the ante-chamber;
7. still others have entered the king's chambers;
8. and only a subset of these have been able to speak with the king, at varying degrees of closeness.

When Maimonides explains his parables, he first does so using the categories of religion.

1. corresponds to those who have no religion, "neither one based on speculation nor one received by tradition"
2. corresponds to those who hold false doctrines/opinions (آراء غير صحيحة), either based on faulty reasoning or based on following the wrong person
3. corresponds to the _ahl al-shari'ah_,
4. of which category 4 is the _jumhur_, or multitude, among them.
5. corresponds to the _fuqaha'_, who learn 'correct opinions' by tradition (اللذين يعتقدون الأراء الصحيحة تقليدا) and do not attempt to establish them by proofs
6. corresponds to those who have "delved into speculation regarding the fundamentals of religion" (خاضو في النظر في أصول الدين)
7. "those who have succeeded in finding a proof for everything that can be proved, who have a true knowledge of God, so far as a true knowledge can be attained, and are near the truth, wherever an approach to the truth is possible"
8. a subset of the seventh, perhaps.
