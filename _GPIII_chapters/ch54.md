In this chapter, Maimonides clarifies that _hikmat_, Hebrew חוכמה, in Scripture can mean one of four things:
1. "knowledge of those truths which lead to the knowledge of God"
2. technique, i.e., wisdom in terms of knowing how to do or make something
3. "acquisition of moral principles"
4. "cunning and subtlety"

and he explains that "a person that has a true knowledge of the whole Law is called wise in a double sense", i.e., he is wise because of reason 1 and because of reason 3. As we can imagine, Maimonides affords the clearly higher rank to (1) than to (3): 
> as the truths contained in the Law are taught by way of tradition, not by a philosophical method, the knowledge of the Law, and the acquisition of true wisdom, are treated in the books of the Prophets and in the words of our Sages as two different things; real wisdom demonstrates by proof those truths which Scripture teaches us by way of tradition. It is to this kind of wisdom, which proves the truth of the Law, that Scripture refers when it extols wisdom, and speaks of the high value of this perfection, and of the consequent paucity of men capable of acquiring it, in sayings like these: “Not many are wise” [Job 32:9](https://sefaria.org/Job.32.9); “But where shall wisdom be found” [ibid. 28:12](https://sefaria.org/Job.28.12).

For Maimonides, there is a "right order", or hierarchy, in which man must acquire wisdom:
1. "we must first learn the truths by tradition"
2. "after this we must be taught how to prove them"
3. "and then investigate the actions that help to improve man’s ways."
