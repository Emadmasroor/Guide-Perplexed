Maimonides states that transient bodies are subject to destruction only from the persepctive of their matter (من جهة مادتها) and not through their form (من جهة الصورة): the _form_ of things is permanent, while their matter is transitory. Thus, if we think of bodies as consisting of (1) matter and (2) form, for Maimonides it is clear that the former is lowly while the latter is exalted; matter is always changing, always transforming, and always transient; but form, as form, is permanent.

Note: in this chapter, Friedlander seems to have translated the word _maadda_ as 'substance', but 'matter' is probably more appropriate. I should check what Pines has.

> It is therefore clear that all corruption, destruction, or defect comes from matter. Take, e.g., man ... all weakness, interruption, or disorder of his actions ... originate in the transient matter, not in the form. ... Man’s shortcomings and sins are all due to the substance of the body and not to its form; while all his merits are exclusively due to his form. Thus the knowledge of God, the formation of ideas, the mastery of desire and passion, the distinction between that which is to be chosen and that which is to be rejected, all these man owes to his form; but eating, drinking, sexual intercourse, excessive lust, passion, and all vices, have their origin in the substance of his body.

"It was impossible, according to the wisdom of God, that matter should exist without form ... and it was necessary that the very noble form of man, which is the image and likeness of God, ... should be joined to the substance of dust and darkness, the source of all defect and loss"

This has ethical implications in the Maimonidean worldview. Because man is distinguished by this 'God-like' ability to conquer his passions, one's ability to do so determines one's "station".
