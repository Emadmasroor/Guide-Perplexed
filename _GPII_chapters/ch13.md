In this chapter, Maimonides finally lays out the question of the eternity of the universe, to which he has been alluding throughout the book so far. He claims that, of those who believe in the existence of God, there are three theories:
1. That the Universe was created from nothing
2. That the Universe, including both the heavens and the earth, was fashioned from a primordial substance
3. That the Universe is eternal, and has always been as it is now.

Neither of the three theories deny the existence of God; Maimonides tacks on to the end of the chapter a passing mention of atheists such as Epicurus, but he considers that "it would be superfluous to repeat their views, since the existence of God has been demonstrated whilst their theory is built upon a basis proved to be untenable".

Let's now examine each of these three theories in detail, as Maimonides tells them.

1. Createdness of the Universe:
> Those who follow the Law of Moses, our Teacher, hold that the whole Universe, i.e., everything except God, has been brought by Him into existence out of non-existence. In the beginning God alone existed, and nothing else; neither angels, nor spheres, nor the things that are contained within the spheres existed. He then produced from nothing all existing things such as they are, by His will and desire.
