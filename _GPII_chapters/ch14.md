In this chapter, Maimonides explains the arguments used by Aristotle to prove the eternity of the Universe. It is clear that Maimonides considers him to be the philosopher _par excellence_ because he says
> No notice will be taken of the opinion of any philosopher but that of Aristotle; his opinions alone deserve to be criticized, and if our objections or doubts with regard to any of these be well founded, this must be the case in a far higher degree in respect to all other opponents of our fundamental principles (من خالف قواعد الشريعه).

The first four of the following are Aristotle's own arguments, and the latter three have been put forward by later Aristoteleans (according to Maimonides):
1. An argument from the eternity of motion and time: if we assume that motion had a beginning, then how did the 'first' motion start? Either one would have to posit a 'first' motion that was itself eternal, or we would need an infinite chain of causes. Similarly, since time is a measure of motion, time also is eternal.
2. 
>The First Substance (مادة الأولى) common to the four elements is eternal. For if it had a beginning it would have come into existence from another substance; it would further be endowed with a form, as coming into existence is nothing but receiving Form. But we mean by "First Substance" a formless substance; it can therefore not have come into existence from another substance, and must be without beginning and without end.
3. The heavenly substance (which for Aristotle was a fifth type of matter) performs circular motion rather than the rectilinear motion of the four sublunary elements. Therefore, unlike the four elements of our experience, the heavenly substance "contains no opposite elements" and "whatever is destroyed, owes its destruction to the opposite elements it contains". Hence, the heavens are indestructible and therefore they must be eternal. Maimonides points out that Aristotle therefore assumes a 'one-to-one and onto' correspondence between indestructability and not-having-a-beginning.
4. 
> When the Universe did not yet exist, its existence was either possible or necessary, or impossible. If it was necessary, the Universe could never have been non-existing; if impossible, the Universe could never have been in existence; if possible, the question arises, What was the substratum of that possibility? for there must be in existence something of which that possibility can be predicated. This is a forcible argument in favour of the Eternity of the Universe.
