In this chapter, Maimonides explains the arguments used by Aristotle to prove the eternity of the Universe. It is clear that Maimonides considers him to be the philosopher _par excellence_ because he says
> No notice will be taken of the opinion of any philosopher but that of Aristotle; his opinions alone deserve to be criticized, and if our objections or doubts with regard to any of these be well founded, this must be the case in a far higher degree in respect to all other opponents of our fundamental principles (من خالف قواعد الشريعه).

The methods used by Aristotle are:
1. An argument from the eternity of motion and time: if we assume that motion had a beginning, then how did the 'first' motion start? Either one would have to posit a 'first' motion that was itself eternal, or we would need an infinite chain of causes. Similarly, since time is a measure of motion, time also is eternal.
2. >The First Substance (مادة الأولى) common to the four elements is eternal. For if it had a beginning it would have come into existence from another substance; it would further be endowed with a form, as coming into existence is nothing but receiving Form. But we mean by "First Substance" a formless substance; it can therefore not have come into existence from another substance, and must be without beginning and without end.
