In this chapter, Maimonides argues --- quite convincingly --- that the eternity of the universe has been wrongly assumed by later Aristotleans to have been _proven_ by Aristotle. While he concedes that it was certainly the theory held by Aristotle, he argues that the Philosopher himself didn't consider the question to be firmly settled; he simply believed that the preponderance of the evidence supports the theory of its eternity and not of its creation in time.

Although this chapter is putatively devoted to a 'refutation' of what is widely held to be Aristotle's theory, it is in fact full of the highest kind of praise for the First Teacher. For example, Maimonides writes:
> Aristotle was well aware that he had not proved the Eternity of the Unvierse. ... He knew that he could not prove his theory, and that his arguments and proofs were only apparent and plausible, ... but Aristotle could not have considered them conclusive, **after having himself taught us the rules of logic, and the means by which arguments can be refuted or confirmed** (إذ و أرسطو هو الذي علم الناس طرق البرهان و قوانينه و شرائطه).
