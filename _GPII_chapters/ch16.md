The question of eternity vs. createdness of the Universe is not conclusively decided in favor of either position: both theories are scientifically plausible, but neither has been conclusively demonstrated beyond doubt. Instead of using 'dialectical' methods a la _mutakallemin_ to claim the correctness of the religious position, Maimonides accepts axiomatically --- on the authority of Scripture --- that the Universe had a beginning. This avoids the weaknesses of the _kalam_ proofs as well as the weaknesses of the Aristotlean proofs. 

> I will not deceive myself, and consider [the _mutakallemin_'s] dialectical methods as proofs; and the fact that a certain proposition has been proved by a dialectical argument win never induce me to accept that proposition, but, on the contrary, will weaken my faith in it, and cause me to doubt it. For when we understand the fallacy of a proof, our faith in the proposition itself is shaken. ... Since I ... consider either of the two theories --- viz., the Eternity of the Universe, and the Creation --- as admissible, I accept the latter on the authority of Prophecy, which can teach things beyond the reach of philosophical speculation.
