- The first objection to the theory of creation is that if God created the Universe at a certain point in time, then he must have transitioned from a state of potentiality to a state of actuality (point 5 in the [Guide II.14](https://emadmasroor.github.io/Guide-Perplexed/summaries/ch14/). Maimonides responds that this only applies to corporeal beings which have a substance and a form: when they transition from a state of poentiality to actuality, an agent must exist which effects this transition; an incoporeal ('spiritual') being, on the other hand, if it acts at one time and not another, does not necessitate a transition from potentiality to actuality". It's interesting to note that Maimonides clarifies
> it is not our intention to state the reason why God created at one time and not at another; and ... we do not mean to assert that God acts at one time and not at another ... We have thus refuted the strong objection raised by those who believe in the Eternity of the Universe; since we believe that God is neither a corporeal body nor a force residing in a body, we need not assume that the Creation, after a period of inaction, is due to a change in the Creator Himself.
