highlights: necessity of divine nature; key challenge to Aristotelean worldview
---

In the Aristotelean worldview, says Maimonides, the world is inseparable from God: God is the cause (علته), and the Universe is the necessary (لزم) effect (معلول). This, however, implies "the conclusion that the nature of everything remains constant, that nothing changes its nature in any way". This is the Spinozistic conclusion of Aristotelean metaphysics, and it --- needless to say --- causes problems for the usual religious worldview. 
> **Spinoza [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129):** Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.

It is to this Aristotelean challenge to the Abrahamic worldview that Maimonides turns in this chapter. In the (orthodox) Abrahamic worldview, "all things in the Universe are the result of design, and not merely of necessity"; science, however, seems to show that the universe is a set of necessary effects preceded by necessary causes preceded by causes and so on. Even if this (Aristotelean) science has room for a God as the 'First Cause', that God doesn't seem to be able to do very much except to originate an intricate chain of necessary causes and effects. Maimonides considers this to be a formidable challenge, because he says he will use "arguments almost as forcible as real proofs", and will not fall into the _mutakallemin_'s error of "ignoring the existing nature of things or assuming the existence of atoms, or the successive creation of accidents" in their quest to defeat the Aristotelean challenge. Maimonides is much more measured. While he declares himself to be in agreement with their objectives, he does not agree with their methods, which claim to have proved things which cannot be conclusively proven. 

The chapter is structured as a dialogue between an Aristotelean and a non-Aristotelean believer.
