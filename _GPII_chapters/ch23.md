In setting up the debate between the two positions, eternity and createdness of the Universe, Maimonides explains --- like a good scientist --- that 
> the comparison cannot be trustworthy unless the two theories be considered with the same interest, and if you are predisposed in favour of one of them, be it on account of your training or because of some advantage, you are too blind to see the truth. For that which can be demonstrated you cannot reject, however much you maybe inclined against it; but in questions like those under consideration you are apt to dispute (in consequence of your inclination). You will, however, be able to decide the question, as far as necessary, if you free yourself from passions, ignore customs, and follow only your reason.

In order to settle this (un-provable) question scientifically, Maimonides says that one needs to have
1. sufficient preparation in mathematics, especially logic
2. adequate knowledge of natural science
3. a moral character which is equitable and free from passions

Maimonides is very clear that his intended audience is people who _believe in_ the theory of the Creation on the authority of the Torah, and who may be tempted --- through rational arguments --- to go over to the 'dark side' and support the theory of eternity instead. He understands that there are very convincing opinions on the other side which could "shake your belief in the theory of the Creation ... you would then adopt the theory which is contrary to the fundamental principles of our religion". Interestingly, however, Maimonides has not closed off the door to the Aristotelian position entirely; that open door is that of demonstrative proof; "Only demonstrative proof should be able to make you abandon the theory of the Creation: but such a proof does not exist in Nature."
