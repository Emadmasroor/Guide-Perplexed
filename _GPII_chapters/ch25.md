This chapter contains Maimonides' famous assertion that he would have had no trouble with explaining away the Bible's references to creation in time as metaphor, had the Aristotelian arguments for the eternity of the Universe amounted to conclusive proof. To show the reader that he means what he says, he points out that "[the] passages in Scripture [which] confirm the Creation ... are not more numerous than those in which God is represented as a corporeal being"; yet he has just spent dozens of chapters refuting the plain words of the text. He could have done similarly for the Biblical account of creation.
> But the Eternity of the Universe has not been proved; a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text, and explaining it figuratively, when the opposite theory can be supported by an equally good argument.

However, Maimonides has another, more fundamental reason to hold on to the literal Scriptural understanding that God created the Universe in time. For if he were to accept the theory of Eternity of the Universe, then the entire edifice of the Abrahamic worldview falls to the ground; for then.
> If we were to accept the Eternity of the Universe as taught by Aristotle, that everything in the Universe is the result of fixed laws, that Nature does not change, and that there is nothing supernatural, we should necessarily be in opposition to the foundation of our religion, we should disbelieve all miracles and signs, and certainly reject all hopes and fears derived from Scripture, unless the miracles are also explained figuratively.

So we learn that for Maimonides this is not an obscure question about the cosmological origins of the Universe, without any direct relation with our affairs here on earth. On the contrary, the answer to this question serves as the lynchpin on which "the foundation of our religion" stands; the "[high rampart](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%252C_Part_2.17.4) erected round the Law". 
> Accepting the Creation, we find that miracles are possible, that Revelation is possible,

and that any thorny philosophical questions arising from Scripture can be answered with the formula 
> He willed it so; or, His wisdom decided so. Just as He created the world according to His will, at a certain time, in a certain form, and as we do not understand why His will or His wisdom decided upon that peculiar form, and upon that peculiar time, so we do not know why His will or wisdom determined" things the way God determined them.

Here, we can see that Maimonides does not try too hard to _reconcile_ scripture with philosophocal truth. He finds an 'out': since it is _possible_ that the Universe was brought into its current form by an all-powerful God, it is also _possible_ that God spoke 'mouth to mouth' with Moses, and parted the Red Sea, and sent manna from heaven, and so on. Maimonides realizes that this is the only thread from which hangs the supposed truth of Scripture. For
> if we assume that the Universe has the present form as the result of fixed laws, there is occasion for the above questions; and these could only be answered in an objectionable way, implying denial and rejection of the Biblical texts. ... If the Creation had been demonstrated by proof, even if only according to the [Platonic hypothesis](https://emadmasroor.github.io/Guide-Perplexed/summaries/II/ch13/) , all arguments of the philosophers against us would be of no avail. If, on the other hand, Aristotle had a proof for his theory, the entirety of the Law would be rejected (لسقطت الشريعة بجملتها), and we should be forced to other opinions (و أنقل الأمر لاراء أخرى).
