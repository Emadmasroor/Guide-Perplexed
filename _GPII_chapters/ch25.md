This chapter contains Maimonides' famous assertion that he would have had no trouble with explaining away the Bible's references to creation in time as metaphor, had the Aristotelian arguments for the eternity of the Universe amounted to conclusive proof. To show the reader that he means what he says, he points out that "[the] passages in Scripture [which] confirm the Creation ... are not more numerous than those in which God is represented as a corporeal being"; yet he has just spent dozens of chapters refuting the plain words of the text. He could have done similarly for the Biblical account of creation.
> But the Eternity of the Universe has not been proved; a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text, and explaining it figuratively, when the opposite theory can be supported by an equally good argument.

However, Maimonides has another, more fundamental reason to hold on to the literal Scriptural understanding that God created the Universe in time. For if he were to accept the theory of Eternity of the Universe, then the entire edifice of the Abrahamic worldview falls to the ground; for then.
> If we were to accept the Eternity of the Universe as taught by Aristotle, that everything in the Universe is the result of fixed laws, that Nature does not change, and that there is nothing supernatural, we should necessarily be in opposition to the foundation of our religion, we should disbelieve all miracles and signs, and certainly reject all hopes and fears derived from Scripture, unless the miracles are also explained figuratively.

So we learn that for Maimonides this is not an obscure question about the cosmological origins of the Universe, far from any direct relation with our affairs here on earth. The answer to this question serves as the lynchpin on which "the foundation of our religion" stands; the "high rampart"
