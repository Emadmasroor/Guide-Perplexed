These chapters serve to establish Moses' superiority as a Prophet. Thus, most of his discussion about what Prophecy is, will not apply to Moses but to the ordinary Prophets. The claim is that Moses alone was spoken to directly by God; all other prophets received their revelation through the intermediary of an angel. This point seems to be made --- at least in these chapters --- by appeal to Scriptural authority, rather than using rational arguments.

This point seems to be made directly by the Pentateuch, in [Numbers 12: 6-8](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en): "With him I speak mouth to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he behold the likeness of יהוה.
