In this chapter, Maimonides speaks about the relationship between natural causes and divine causes, and talks about why the Prophets sometimes ascribe God as the cause of things that are simply produced naturally:
> It is clear that everything produced must have an immediate cause which produced it; that cause again a cause, and so on, till the First Cause (_sabab al-awwal_ سبب الأول), viz. (_a'ni_ أعني), the will and decree of God (مشية الله و إختياره) is reached. The prophets therefore omit sometimes the intermediate causes, and ascribe the production of an individual thing directly to God, saying that God has made it.

All sorts of things are ascribed in Scripture to God:
1. "events evidently due to chance"
2. "an animal's desire for some of its natural wants", such as the fish vomiting out Younus
3. "events caused by man's free will"
4. "phenomena produced regularly by natural causes, such as the melting of the snow when the atmosphere becomes warm"

But it is to be understood that there is no special 'intervention' going on here.
