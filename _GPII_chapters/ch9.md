In these chapters, Maimonides makes some remarks on the Aristotelean astronomical system. There are some 'open questions', e.g.:
- How many 'spheres' are there? Like a good scientist, Maimonides is not very concerned about whether Aristotle himself was correct about the exact number of spheres; if one counts nine, then a great number of heavenly bodies are assigned to one sphere (plus seven individual ones for the sun, the moon, and the five classical planets). Under the same principle, one could consider the universe to have, say, two spheres --- apparently, [Deuteronomy 10:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.14) was believed to lend itself to such an interpretation --- by 'rolling up' multiple heavenly bodies into the same sphere.
- It was not known whether Mercury and Venus are 'above' the sun (in a geocentric frame of reference)
