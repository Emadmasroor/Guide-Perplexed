In these chapters, Maimonides makes some remarks on the Aristotelean astronomical system. There are some 'open questions', e.g.:
- How many 'spheres' are there? Like a good scientist, Maimonides is not very concerned about whether Aristotle himself was correct about the exact number of spheres; if one counts nine, then a great number of heavenly bodies are assigned to one sphere (plus seven individual ones for the sun, the moon, and the five classical planets). Under the same principle, one could consider the universe to have, say, two spheres --- apparently, [Deuteronomy 10:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.14) was believed to lend itself to such an interpretation --- by 'rolling up' multiple heavenly bodies into the same sphere.
- It was not known whether Mercury and Venus are 'above' the sun (in a geocentric frame of reference) or below it; Maimonides discusses the views of different astronomers on this question at great length. Maimonides seems to prefer the former view.

The astronomical system thus looks like this:
1. the moon
2. the sun
3. the five planets in succession, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
4. the fixed stars.

Grouped in this way, the sky therefore consists of four 'spheres'. Maimonides links these four spheres to the sublunary world; all the heavenly spheres affect the sublunary world, but each has a particular affinity with, and is the cause for the motion of, one of the four elements:
- the moon is related to water, as is evident from the tides;
- the sun is related to fire, as is evendient from its heating effect;
- the planets are related to air, since they "move in many and different courses with retrogressions, progressions, and stations, and therefore produce the various forms of the air with its frequent changes"
