Maimonides sets out 25 propositions common to Peripatetic philosphers; he acceps all of these. There is also a proposition 26, "Time and motion are eternal, constant, and in actual existence" --- which Maimonides accepts for the sake of argument.

It is Maimonides' belief that this last proposition was never conclusively proven by Aristotle, and that the First Teacher merely considerred it to be the "most probable and acceptable proposition". He believes that it is the followers of Aristotle who have morphed his tentative assertion into an incontrovertible statement of truth. What Maimonides is willing to admit is that 
> his proposition is admissible, but neither demonstrative, as the commentators of Aristotle assert, nor, on the other hand, impossible, as the Mutakallemim say.
