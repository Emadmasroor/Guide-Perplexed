In chapter 1, Maimonides begins with a discussion of the phrase "Let us make man in our image" from [Genesis 1:26](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.26), and writes about how the use of the word "image" (Arabic: صورة ; Hebrew: צלם) misleads people into thinking that the Bible describes a corporeal God. In other words, a literal reading of the Torah seems to suggest that God has a body with a face and limbs.

Maimonides is at pains to explain that this literal reading is wrong, not least because it denies the greatness of God. It is in this chapter that he sets out his tripartite skeleton for a theology that is consistent with the Law: that God exists, that he is One, and that he is Incorporeal. In fact, he insists, "there is no real unity without incorporeality".

The words of the Bible must mean, of course, that man is "similar" to God for some meaning of the word "similar" (with apologies to the author for using a word he would undoubtedly have disapproved of). For Maimonides, the way in which man has been created "in God's image" is by virtue of his ability to intellect ("إدراك الإنساني" or "إدراك العقلي"). This is what sets man apart from all other living things, and also accounts for why God said "نَعْمَلُ الانْسَانَ عَلَى صُورَتِنَا كَشَبَهِنَا" in Genesis 1.26.
