The following have to be negatively "demonstrated by proof" with reference to God:
- corporeality: for reasons already elaborated
- passiveness: because if God could be the recipient of any actions, then another being would exist that could act on Him
- potentiality: because "potentiality always implies non-existence (كل قوة يقارنها عدم ضرورة)" 
- similarity to any existing being

For demonstrating all these points, Maimonides says that "our knowledge of God is aided by the study of Natural Science", which helps us understand, for example, "the non-existence implied in all potentiality", and other such fine points which necessitate negating all four of these for God.

> He who knows these things, but without their proofs, does not know the details which logically result from these general propositions: and therefore he cannot prove that God exists, or that the [four] things mentioned above are inadmissible in reference to God
