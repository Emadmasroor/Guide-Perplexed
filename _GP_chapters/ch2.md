A questioner once asked Maimonides: How is it that the punishment for Adam's sin (i.e., eating from the tree of life) resulted in the granting to mankind of that unique faculty which gives us فوقیت over all other created beings, i.e. the ability to distinguish between good and evil?
> ... it thus appears strange that the punishment for rebelliosness should be the means of elevating man to a pinnacle of perfection to which he had not attained previously.
