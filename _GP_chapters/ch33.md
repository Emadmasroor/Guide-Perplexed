In these chapters, Maimonides warns against beginning one's philosophical studies with Metaphysics (_ilm al-ilahi_ العلم إلهي), and likens this to feeding an infant with food meant for adults.
> He, however, who begins with Metaphysics, will not only become confused in matters of religion, but will fall into complete infidelity. I compare such a person to an infant fed with wheaten bread, meat, and wine; it will undoubtedly die, not because such food is naturally unfit for the human body, but because of the weakness of the child, who is unable to digest the food, and cannot derive benefit from it.

In truth, far from being injurious to the (properly prepared) student, Maimonides considers learning the secrets of metaphysics to be the apotheosis of religious belief, because it puts those beliefs which one initially acquires through Scripture in allegorical language on a firm, scientific foundation; such a person will "have a true notion of those things which he previously received in similes and metaphors".
