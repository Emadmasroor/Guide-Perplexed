In this chapter, Maimonides explains to the reader that philosophers (Huseyin Atay's Arabic has _ahl al-ilm_ أهل العلم) often have to prove things that would be manifestly obvious to people "if man had been left in his primitive state". But due to the corrupting influence of false notions, it is sometimes necessary to give proofs for these self-evident truths. As an example, he states that Aristotle found it necessary to give a proof even for the existence of motion.

"To the same class belongs the rejection of essential attributes in reference to God (_nafi al-sifaat al-zatiyah 'an Allah ta'aala_ نفي الصفات الذاتية عن الله تعالى)," he says.
