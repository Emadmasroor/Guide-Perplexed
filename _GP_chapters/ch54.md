Knowing God, of course, is very important in Maimonides' schema. 
> "Not only is he acceptable and welcome to God who fasts and prays (صام و صلى), but everyone who knows Him (بل كل من عرفه). ... The pleasure and displeasure of God, the approach to Him and the withdrawal from Him are proportional to the amount of man's knowledge or ignorance concerning the Creator.

To know something is to know its attributes, and God's attributes are nothing but his actions, his _tariqa_ طريقة, according to Maimonides. He finds support for this position in the story of Moses' conversation with God. Moses asked God to 'show me now thy way (_tariqak_ طريقك), that I may know thee' ([Exodus XXXIII.13](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.33.13)), which --- according to Maimonides --- is evidence that Moses knew that "God is known by His attributes, for Moses believed that he knew Him, when he was shown the way of God".

God's reply to this was "I will make all My goodness pass before you". 'all my Goodness' is the word "_kul-tubi_ כל־טובי" in Hebrew, which uses the same word as Genesis I.10 "And God saw that it was good _tuv_ טוב). Thus, Maimonides seems to interpret the question-and-answer between Moses and God to mean that 
1. God is known by his ways, and
2. God's ways, i.e., his actions, are the works of this world: the stuff of creation.

Maimonides says that "God promised to make him comprehend the nature of all things, their relation to each other, and the way they are governed by God ... The knowledge of the works of God is the knolwedge of his attributes".
