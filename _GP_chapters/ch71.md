In this chapter, Maimonides mounts a strong criticism on the practice of kalam. His main criticism is that the practitioners of kalam --- in their zeal to defend faith against philosophy --- get ahead of themselves and use incomplete proofs. At one point, he says that they
> did not investigate the real properties of things: first of all they considered what must be the properties of the things which should yield proof for or against a certain creed; and when this was found they asserted that the thing must be endowed with those properties; then they employed the same assertion as a proof for the identical arguments which had led to the assertion, and by which they either supported or refuted a certain opinion.

His response to this is a sober philospher's response:
> I tell you, however, as a general rule, that Themistius was right in saying that the properties of things cannot adapt themselves to our opinions, but our opinions must be adapted to the existing properties.

He also takes issue with the way that _mutakallemin_ weigh in on the debate about the eternity of the world. He says that 
> they invariably begin with proving the creatio ex nihilo, and establish on that proof the existence of God. I have examined this method, and find it most objectionable. It must be rejected, because all the proofs for the creation have weak points, and cannot be considered as convincing except by those who do not know the difference between a proof, a dialectical argument, and a sophism. Those who understand the force of the different methods will clearly see that all the proofs for the creation are questionable, because propositions have been employed which have never been proved.

He is sympathetic to the theological need for _creatio ex nihilo_, but because the debate has been raging "for the last three thousand years", he believes that the best which can be hoped for is 
> to expose the shortcomings in the proofs of philosophers who hold that the Universe is eternal, and if forsooth a man has effected this, he has accomplished a great deed!

Thus, Maimonides reveals where his sympathies lie, but concedes that
