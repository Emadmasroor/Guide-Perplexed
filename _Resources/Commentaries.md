1. **Fox, Marvin**. _Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy_. University of Chicago Press, 1995. This book begins, in its first chapter 'The Many-sided Maimonides', with the observation that "It is remarkable that despite the vast literature on many aspects of the work of Moses Maimonides, we do not have even one comprehensive study of his thought that compares in cquality and scope to the great works that have been written on almost every important Western philosopher." He then cites several such comprehensive studies, e.g., Wolfson's _Philosophy of Spinoza_. This is despite the fact that, "in the eight hundred years since the _Guide_ first appeared, there has never been a time when interest in the _Guide_ was absent ... Maimonides has never disappeared from the Jewish scholarly agenda."

Marvin Fox attributes this to the esoteric nature of the _Guide_, and to the seemingly conflicting ideological commitments which Maimonides seems to espouse in his philosophical writing. There is also the matter of Maimonides' towering stature in the Jewish (and broad mediaeval) canon, which makes it a weighty task to claim to give an authoritative account of his thought. The result, Fox says, is that "We still cannot say with certainty just what could be considered a thoroughly reliable account of Maimonides' doctrines".

Will Marvin Fox give us such an account? It is not clear, although we do read the author's admission that "My own studies of Maimonides began in my early youth, and he has never ceased to occupy my thought and my attention. ... To add to the existing literature takes a certain boldness. ... Over the years I have become convinced that there are, in fact, many dimensions of Maimondes' work that have not been grasped or explicated as correctly or as fully as possible." His ideological commitments are clear: "I consider Maimonides to be the greatest and most creative Jewish thinker since the close of the Talmud."

In my estimation, Marvin Fox's book represents the best that a Maimonides _tafsir_ can be, because it comes from a writer who is convinced, sincerely, that Maimonides' work has a lot to offer the modern reader, and works eloquently to show us what this is. His closing chapter, _The Significance of Maimonides for contemporary Judaism_ sums up the insights that he distills for us, guiding us toward "one of the greatest of all teachers, whose voice speaks effectively to our own age."
