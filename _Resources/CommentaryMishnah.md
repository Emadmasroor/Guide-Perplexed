# Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah and its relationship to the Guide: The Young Moses

The _Commentary on the Mishnah_ (not to be confused with the _Mishneh Torah_) is one of the Rambam's earliest extant works, and was completed in the year 1168 when he was 33 years old. Unlike the _Mishneh Torah_, the _Commentary on the Mishnah_ was written in Arabic, and titled _Kitab al-Siraj_; however, the book appears to have survived into modern times chiefly in Hebrew translations, sometimes of individual Mishnah tractates. In either language, the book appears to have been known by a similar name; _sefer haMoar_ in Hebrew and _kitab al-Siraj_ in Arabic. It is notable that the _Commentary_, targeted to a Jewish readership, and intended to popularize the Talmud amongst the reading-public of the day, was written in Arabic (in Hebrew characters), unlike Maimonides' later more well-known religious work, the _Mishneh Torah_, which was written in Hebrew.

The _Commentary on the Mishnah_ (_CM_) has never been translated fully into English; pieces of this work have individually made their way into some collections of Maimonides' writings, but the entire work remains accessible only in Hebrew; it is unclear whether the Arabic text is extant. Here, English-language excerpts are taken from Fred Rosner, _Moses Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah: Introduction to Seder Zeraim and Commentary on Tractate Berachot_, Feldheim Publishers, New York (1975).

In this essay, I would like to highlight how the _CM_ relates to the _GP_, in some ways prefiguring the later work and in other ways standing in sharp contrast to it. Thus, the _CM_ may offer us some clues in understanding what we can perhaps call 'the Young Moses (ben Maimon)'.

## Prophecy in the Commentary on the Mishnah

The _CM_ is the site of Maimonides' well-known promise to one day write a "book about Prophecy"; it is often believed that the Guide _is_ that book, since Prophecy is one of its chief subjects. In the _CM_, Maimonides writes:

> There are many additional details regarding the subject (of prophecy), and it is impossible to collect them all together (here). Discussions thereon and proof for each one are to be found in verses of the books of the Torah and in the words of the Prophets. This whole subject would require an entire book in itself. Perhaps God will help us in compiling what is appropriate in a book on that subject. (p.50)

However, Maimonides' approach to prophecy in the _CM_ appears to be somewhat different from his approach in the _Guide_. In the former work, he is more concerned with establishing criteria for how to determine, objectively, whether a claimant to prophethood is a _true_ prophet. How does one distinguish between a true prophet and a false one? Well, among other things, he appears to place a great deal of emphasis on the predictions that a true Prophet makes.

> Should now the prophet be eligible to prophesy, then we tell him to provide us assurance by means of specific predictions, and to tell us things which the Holy One Blessed Be He taught him. He will then relate this to us and reassure as and, should all his predictions become fulfilled, then we will know that his entire prophecy is true. Should he falsify, though, or should one of his statements, even a minor point, be unsustained, then we will know he is a false prophet.

Immediately afterward, he acknowledges that this could cause a problem: the world is full of "enchanters, astrologers and spiritualists" who make prognostications, and "since we often observe them, eye to eye, predicting what the future will bring", one could ask why they, too, could not be considered legitimate prophets. Although he is sharp in his identification of this problem, his solution is (خاکم بدہن) somewhat lacklustre. He states:

> I say that the enchanters, astrologers, and other people in that category do predict common future happenings, but only some (of the predictions) will be rightm and some will be wrong, of necessity. This we see constantly, and even the performers of such an art will agree to this, and they would not gainsay their own signs. ...
