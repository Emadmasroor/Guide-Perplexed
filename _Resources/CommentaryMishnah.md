# Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah and its relationship to the Guide: The Young Moses

The _Commentary on the Mishnah_ (not to be confused with the _Mishneh Torah_) is one of the Rambam's earliest extant works, and was completed in the year 1168 when he was 33 years old. Unlike the _Mishneh Torah_, the _Commentary on the Mishnah_ was written in Arabic, and titled _Kitab al-Siraj_; however, the book appears to have survived into modern times chiefly in Hebrew translations, sometimes of individual Mishnah tractates. In either language, the book appears to have been known by a similar name; _sefer haMoar_ in Hebrew and _kitab al-Siraj_ in Arabic. It is notable that the _Commentary_, targeted to a Jewish readership, and intended to popularize the Talmud amongst the reading-public of the day, was written in Arabic (in Hebrew characters), unlike Maimonides' later more well-known religious work, the _Mishneh Torah_, which was written in Hebrew.

The _Commentary on the Mishnah_ (_CM_) has never been translated fully into English; pieces of this work have individually made their way into some collections of Maimonides' writings, but the entire work remains accessible only in Hebrew; it is unclear whether the Arabic text is extant. Here, English-language excerpts are taken from Fred Rosner, _Moses Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah: Introduction to Seder Zeraim and Commentary on Tractate Berachot_, Feldheim Publishers, New York (1975). There is also a translation by Rabbi Francis Nataf, which is available on Sefaria.

In this essay, I would like to highlight how the _CM_ relates to the _GP_, in some ways prefiguring the later work and in other ways standing in sharp contrast to it. Thus, the _CM_ may offer us some clues in understanding what we can perhaps call 'the Young Moses (ben Maimon)'.

## Prophecy in the Commentary on the Mishnah

The _CM_ is the site of Maimonides' well-known promise to one day write a "book about Prophecy"; it is often believed that the Guide _is_ that book, since Prophecy is one of its chief subjects. In the _CM_, Maimonides writes:

> There are many additional details regarding the subject (of prophecy), and it is impossible to collect them all together (here). Discussions thereon and proof for each one are to be found in verses of the books of the Torah and in the words of the Prophets. This whole subject would require an entire book in itself. Perhaps God will help us in compiling what is appropriate in a book on that subject. (p.50)

However, Maimonides' approach to prophecy in the _CM_ appears to be somewhat different from his approach in the _Guide_. In the former work, he is more concerned with establishing criteria for how to determine, objectively, whether a claimant to prophethood is a _true_ prophet. How does one distinguish between a true prophet and a false one? Well, among other things, he appears to place a great deal of emphasis on the predictions that a true Prophet makes.

> Should now the prophet be eligible to prophesy, then we tell him to provide us assurance by means of specific predictions, and to tell us things which the Holy One Blessed Be He taught him. He will then relate this to us and reassure as and, should all his predictions become fulfilled, then we will know that his entire prophecy is true. Should he falsify, though, or should one of his statements, even a minor point, be unsustained, then we will know he is a false prophet.

Immediately afterward, he acknowledges that this could cause a problem: the world is full of "enchanters, astrologers and spiritualists" who make prognostications, and "since we often observe them, eye to eye, predicting what the future will bring", one could ask why they, too, could not be considered legitimate prophets. Although he is sharp in his identification of this problem, his solution is (خاکم بدہن) somewhat lacklustre. He states:

> I say that the enchanters, astrologers, and other people in that category do predict common future happenings, but only some (of the predictions) will be right and some will be wrong, of necessity. This we see constantly, and even the performers of such an art will agree to this, and they would not gainsay their own signs. ... And the predictions and the proofs of the prophets are not like this, but [rather] everything is realized to the last word, and not one of their words fails – not a small one and not a large one – for all time, in that which he speaks about in the name of God. And therefore, if one of his words [ends up being] empty, we know his untruth; and that is what it stated (II Kings 10:10), "nothing that the Lord has spoken [...] shall fall to the ground." [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.7.21?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%94&with=Lexicon&lang2=en)

Therefore, astonishingly for a reader of the _Guide_, Maimonides appears to hinge the whole prophetic enterprise on, well, correct and fully-realized prophecies about the future. Thus, according to the Rambam in the _CM_, a prophet whose predictions do not turn out correctly is a _false_ prophet. 

Next, the Rambam further qualifies this claim by differentiating between 'good' predictions and 'bad' predictions, i.e., predictions about good events vs. predictions about bad events.
- If a prophet prophecies calamities on his people, it is possible that "Heaven will have compassion, and all their affairs will remain in peace and contentment. One cannot, in this manner, know the untruth of such a prophet... It is also possible that they did penance and turned from their provocative acts, or that the Holy One blessed Be He deferred their punishment in His compassion."
- If a prophet promises unconditional good tidings to his people, "then for this good not to become fulfilled is impossible and cannot be."

It should not be surprising that the Commentary on the Mishnah lacks any of the Neoplatonic language of the _Guide_'s [description of prophecy](../summaries/II/ch36/). In that work, Maimonides clearly describes Prophecy in terms of an emanation. However, the Commentary on the Mishnah is meant to be a layman's book, and has a more religious character, so it makes sense that it would avoid the philosophical terminology found in the _Guide_.

What is surprising, however, is that the _Guide_ lacks any mention of the clairvoyance of a prophet as having any bearing on the truth of his prophecy. Here are some possible options.
- Maimonides changed his mind between the writing of the _Commentary on the Mishnah_ and the writing of the _Guide_. The former was completed by 1168, whereas the latter was completed in the late 1190s. Certainly that's a long enough time for a serious thinker to change his mind.
- The two books are written for different audiences; he considers the clairvoyance test to be a sufficient criterion when teaching the lay Jewish audience, but reserves the more sophisticated understanding of prophecy for his beloved student and others like him.
- The Straussian interpretation here would be that he himself believed in the Neoplatonized account of prophecy, but he promulgated the _CM_'s account of prophecy as a form of 'dissimulation'.
