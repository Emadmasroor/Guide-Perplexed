Harry A. Wolfson, _The Philosophy of Spinoza_ Vol.I Chapter 1 pg 20: 
> [His philosophy] has grown out of the very philosophy which he discards, and this by his relentless driving of its own internal criticism of itself to its ultimate logical conclusion.

Spinoza [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129): 
> Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.

Steven Nadler, _A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age_, Chapter 4 p.65:
> In the _Treatise_, Spinoza is deeply concerned to combat this notion of the prophet-philosopher [i.e., Maimonides' theory of prophecy]. One of the goals of the work is to secure the separation of the domains of religion and philosophy so that philosophers might be free to pursue secular wisdom unimpeded by ecclesiastic authority.

Steven Nadler, [_Why Spinoza Still Matters_](https://aeon.co/essays/at-a-time-of-zealotry-spinoza-matters-more-than-ever):
> Spinoza is often labelled a 'pantheist', but 'atheist' is a more appropriate term.

Steven Nadler, _A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age_, Chapter 3 p.50:
> Spinoza was always deeply offended by the accusation that he was an atheist, particularly if the charge meant, as his Voorburg opponents claimed, that he "mocks all religions." ... Spinoza writes, "Does that man, pray, renounce all religion who declares that God must be acknowledged as the highest good, and that he must be loved as such in a free spirit? And that in this alone does our supreme happiness and our highest freedom consist?"

Maimonides departs from Aristotle on the question of the eternity of the Universe, but this is related to (and perhaps anciliary to) the question whether the Universe is entirely governed by natural laws. In the Guide II.20, Maimonides [says](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_2.20.1?lang=en)
> For as it is impossible to reconcile two opposites, so it is impossible to reconcile the two theories, that of [1] necessary existence by causality, and [2] that of Creation by the desire and will of a Creator

Maimonides emphatically rejects [1] and supports [2]. Spinoza, who had access to the Keplerian hypothesis and therefore no longer saw the same deficiencies that Maimonides did in the Aristotelian system, asserted [1] in [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129) and denied [2] in [Ethics 1.17 sch](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#117sc). In doing so, he takes the opposite position to Maimonides while staying true to the latter's philosophical framework.

According to [Carlos Fraenkel](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9385-1_3) (in _Spinoza on Philosophy and Religion: The Averroistic Sources_, book chapter in _The Rationalists: Between Tradition and Innovation_) points out that the expression 'truth does not contradict truth' was used by Spinoza in _Cogitata Metaphysica_ (as 'veritas veritati non repugnat'). This phrase, of course, has a pedigree in Averroes' _Decisive Treatise_ where he uses it in the form (الحق لا يضاد الحق) _al-haqq la yuzad al-haq_. For Averroes, this statement is a lead-in to an allegorical interpretation of those parts of Scripture or religious tradition which contradict with philosophical truth. According to Fraenkel, Spinoza too held such a view at one point, although it seems very different from the position that Spinoza ultimately takes in the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_.

Fraenkel's argument is that Spinoza follows Averroes rather than Maimonides in his 'resolution' of the conflict between 'Jerusalem and Athens'. Averroes' position is that the inner, allegorical meaning is the 'true meaning' of Scripture, but this is not accessible to the multitude because it takes philosophical reasoning to understand, from first princriples, why one should lead a virtuous life. So, religion is a kind of 'short cut' to the virtuous life for the multitude. Fraenkel believes that "an Averroist would not attempt to resolve contradictions between philosophy and theology by composing an allegorical commentary on problematic passages in scripture as Maimonides did, for instance, with Biblical anthropomorphisms". (1) There is no need to do this because the multitude can continue to follow the literal meaning of Scripture with no harm to them, and (2) this could be dangerous because if people's belief in the literal sense of religion is destroyed, and if they do not have the philosophical capacity to arrive at correct opinions about how to live purely by way of reason, then they would be left with no guide. Fraenkel references Averroes' dictum that
> The philosopher is prohibited from intervening in the beliefs of popular religion even if they are philosophically as untenable as the anthropomorphic representation of God. ... [According to Averroes], philosophical doctrines may only be recorded in books that employ scientific demonstrations. For these, according to Averroes, are protected by their difficulty: books which “use demonstrations are accessible only to those who understand demonstrations” (Faṣl al-maqâl, 21). This, of course, is as true for Spinoza’s Ethics, 450 years later, as it is for Averroes’ commentaries on Aristotle.

1. Maimonides believes that the question of whether the world is eternal or created-in-time is not conclusively settled by philosophical speculation, and that from purely rational arguments we are forced to conclude (based on the scientific evidence available in the 12th century) that we do not know which one is true.
2. Nevertheless, he chooses to believe in creation-in-time "on the authority of Our Teacher Moses".
3. He expressly says that his reason for this decision is _not_ that a literal reading of Genesis tells us that God created the world at a certain instance of time, famously asserting that he would have had no trouble with interpreting the Genesis narrative allegorically had the scientific evidence for an eternal universe been conclusive.
4. Nevertheless, he says that believing in creation-in-time is extremely important, and that the theory of the eternity of the world is "contrary to the fundamental principles of our religion". Why?
5. If one accepts creation-in-time, then miracles and prophecy also become possible. He does not directly state the converse, but we can conjecture: if creation-in-time were conclusively disproven, would miracles and prophecy become impossible?
6. Creation-in-time has a bearing on the question of whether the entirety of Nature is subject to fixed laws, or whether there is a supra-natural power of God which shaped the Universe, at least in the early days? This question is so important to Maimonides that he stakes the entirety of the law on it. "If Aristotle had a proof for his theory ... then we should be forced to other opinions".
7. He believes that there is no difference between (1) believing in an a Universe which proceeds from God the way all effects proceed from their causes and (2) believing that the Universe is the result of a voluntary act of the design/will/determination of God, but it has always been so.
8.

[GP.III.32](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.32.1?lang=en) begins with "On considering the Divine acts, or the processes of Nature, we get an insight into...". The Arabic goes "إذا تاملت الأفعال الإلهي أعني الأفعال الطبيعية". It has been speculated by none less than Shlomo Pines that this expression of Maimonides may have suggested to Spinoza the famous formula tion _Deus sive Natura_. There is certainly a linguistic parallelism, if we ignore for a moment that Maimonides talks about _actions_ whereas Spinoza does not restrict his _sive_ to the actions of God or nature. 

- Maimonides says "الأفعال الإلهي, أعني, الأفعال الطبيعية": "the actions of God, that is, the actions of Nature"
- Spinoza says "God, _sive_, Nature"

It might be instructive to look into the sort of equivalence set up by the Arabic أعني and the sort of equivalence set up by the Latin _sive_.

But in at least two of the three places in the _Ethics_ where Spinoza uses this phrase, his argument never strays too far from Maimonides' circumscribed equivalence of the _actions_ of God with the _actions_ of Nature. Consider the preface to Part IV of the Ethics in Elwes' translation:
> Now we showed in the Appendix to Part I., that Nature does not work with an end in view. For the eternal and infinite Being, which we call God or Nature, **acts** by the same necessity as that whereby it exists.

Although Maimonides differs from Spinoza in the _conclusion_ which is stated here (for Maimonides, God _does not_ act by necessity but has free will), notice that the two preceding premises are entirely shared between them.
1. "Nature does not work with an end in view". This is an opinion which was strongly held by Maimonides, and in Part III ...
2. the actions of God and the actions of Nature are one and the same. This was stated explicitly by Maimonides in [GP.III.32](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.32.1?lang=en).

## Spinoza on Jesus

Most of my thoughts on this topic are indebted to Melamed, Yitzhak. "“Christus secundum spiritum”: Spinoza, Jesus and the infinite intellect." Jesus among the Jews. Routledge, 2012. 152-163. In fact, I am not sure if there's anything new I'm going to say here. 

slightly important **disclaimer** for the reader: I don't claim to believe any of these things lol. 

Spinoza's views on Jesus are somewhat enigmatic. His 'God' is nothing like the usual God of the Abrahamic faiths, and so we would expect, at first glance, that a God who does not even possess a will, much less a 'personality', cannot possibly have much to do with the Christian God who manifests himself in the person of Jesus, walks around, and interacts with humans. At the same time, however, his works _do_ include references to Christ; the _Ethics_ uses the word 'Christ' at least once, and the _Theoloigcal-Political Treatise_ uses the word several times. What, exactly, does Spinoza understand by Jesus?

Harry Wolfson, toward the end of his monumental work on Spinoza, describes the following moving scene.

> And I can picture him, once of a Sunday, at the invitation of the good old Doctor, taking the services in the church. He preaches a sermon which is an invective against what he styles "the prejudices of the theologians of our time." ' In it he inveighs against prevailing credulous beliefs in the spirituality of God, His  personal relation to men. His direct guidance of human affairs, the divine origin of the Scriptures, human freedom of the will, the separability of soul from body, and the survival of the soul after death as an individual entity. The sermon over, he pauses and says, "Now let us pray." And in his prayer he thanks God, "the creator of the universe," for His bountiful goodness; he begs for the forgiveness of "our sins," asks for divine enlightenment in the true understanding of "Thy revealed Word," and petitions for divine grace in "guiding us" in the paths of righteousness, to the end that "we may inherit" life everlasting and enjoy eternal bliss in the presence of "Thy glory." As he is about to close his prayer, he catches a glimpse of the congregation and suddenly realizes that he is in a Christian church. Immediately he adds: " In the name of Christ, the mouth of God,' whose spirit is the idea of God, which alone leads us unto liberty, salvation, blessedness, and regeneration. Amen."

Wolfson has succeeded in the unthinkable: he has crafted from the words of the "atheist" (see: Nadler) and heretical (see: the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam, going strong for 400-ish years) Spinoza a pious and even Christian sermon. Clearly, for Spinoza, Jesus' spirit if the 'idea of God', which --- if we take some linguistic latitude and interpret this as meaning 'the Word of God', or the _λόγος_ --- means that Spinoza is happy to think of Jesus Christ as being the Word of God. But what does this mean? Does this mean that Spinoza essentially agrees with John 1? Let us start from John 1 in its most strongly Homoousistic form, and through a series of substitutions arrive at the words of Spinoza.

1. Word = God
2. Christ = God (substitute Christ for Word)
3. spirit of Christ = God (substitute 'spirit of Christ' for Christ)
4. spirit of Christ = idea of God (substitute 'idea of God' for God)

Thus, it would be a stretch to say that Spinoza's identification of the spirit of Christ with the idea of God is in agreement with the words of John 1, and even more of a stretch to say that he is in agreement with the 'consubstantial with God' of the Nicene creed. There seems to be little room in Spinoza's thought for a God who can become incarnate as a human being; it must have been in tacit response to the Christian understanding of Jesus that he wrote in one of his letters (LVI), "A triangle, if only it had the power of speech, would say in like manner that God is eminently triangular". The pedigree of this idea apparently goes all the way to [Xenophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes), quoted on p.451 of _The Correspondence of Spinoza_, quoting from Burnet _Early Greek Philosophy_.

Henry Oldenburg (Letter LXXIV) put the question to Spinoza clearly:
> Moreover they say that you conceal your opinion of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world, and the only Mediator for mankind, and of his Incarnation and Atonement; and they want you to open your mind clearly on [this head].

and Spinoza's reply,
> it is not entirely necessary to salvation to know Christ according to the flesh ...

suggests that he does not really believe that being a follower of the person, Jesus, is important to 'salvation', i.e., he does not believe that this is an important part of 'true religion', such as it is.

He then continues,
> ... but we must think far otherwise of the eternal son of God, that is, the eternal wisdom of God ...

'far otherwise' here means that Spinoza thinks that it is **definitely** important for salvation to know 'the eternal son of God', the Word that was with God from the beginning, the _logos_ that undergirds all reality, and the divine Wisdom that is identical with the essence of God. So far so good: Spinoza identifies an entity ("the eternal son of God, i.e., the eternal wisdom of God") which Christians can take to mean Jesus, whereas Spinoza could take to mean something different. But then he goes on:
> ... which has manifested itself in all things, more especially in the human mind, and most of all in Christ Jesus.

so the eternal wisdom of God is not something _outside_ the Universe; the eternal wisdom of God manifests itself in the entire Universe; _everything_ can be considered a manifestation of the eternal wisdom of God. We can set up a hierarchy, consisting of ever more restricted spheres within which we can understand the world:

1. **God**
2. the eternal **wisdom of God** (a.k.a. the 'eternal son of God')
3. which has manifested itself in **all things**
4. more especially in the **human mind**
5. and most of all in **Christ Jesus**

Thus, Jesus qua human is not that important for salvation; one might or might not 'know' Jesus in that sense. But it _is_ important to 'know Christ according to the spirit', as Yitzhak Melamed would say. But for this it is important to simply know the 'eternal wisdom of God' which is available to all of us, since it "has manifested itself in all things, more especially in the human mind". 


> For without this wisdom no one can attain to a state of blessendess, inasmuch as it alone teaches what is true and what is false, what is good and what is evil.

The 'Word' comes pre-inscribed in the works of God, especially in our own minds, and it should (in theory) be possible to discover the idea of God and gain a correct understanding of truth and righteousness and be led into salvation, blessedness and everlasting life without having known Jesus.

> For the rest, as to the doctrine which certain Churches add to these, namely, that God assumed human nature, I expressly warned them that I do not understand what they say. Indeed, to confess the truth, they seem to me to speak no less absurdly than if some one were to tell me that a circle had assumed the nature of a square.

He ends the note by saying "Whether this opinion will please the Christians whom you know, you will be able to judge better than I can."
