Harry A. Wolfson, _The Philosophy of Spinoza_ Vol.I Chapter 1 pg 20: 
> [His philosophy] has grown out of the very philosophy which he discards, and this by his relentless driving of its own internal criticism of itself to its ultimate logical conclusion.

Spinoza [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129): 
> Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.

Steven Nadler, _A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age_, Chapter 4 p.65:
> In the _Treatise_, Spinoza is deeply concerned to combat this notion of the prophet-philosopher [i.e., Maimonides' theory of prophecy]. One of the goals of the work is to secure the separation of the domains of religion and philosophy so that philosophers might be free to pursue secular wisdom unimpeded by ecclesiastic authority.

Steven Nadler, [_Why Spinoza Still Matters_](https://aeon.co/essays/at-a-time-of-zealotry-spinoza-matters-more-than-ever):
> Spinoza is often labelled a 'pantheist', but 'atheist' is a more appropriate term.

Steven Nadler, _A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age_, Chapter 3 p.50:
> Spinoza was always deeply offended by the accusation that he was an atheist, particularly if the charge meant, as his Voorburg opponents claimed, that he "mocks all religions." ... Spinoza writes, "Does that man, pray, renounce all religion who declares that God must be acknowledged as the highest good, and that he must be loved as such in a free spirit? And that in this alone does our supreme happiness and our highest freedom consist?"

Maimonides departs from Aristotle on the question of the eternity of the Universe, but this is related to (and perhaps anciliary to) the question whether the Universe is entirely governed by natural laws. In the Guide II.20, Maimonides [says](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_2.20.1?lang=en)
> For as it is impossible to reconcile two opposites, so it is impossible to reconcile the two theories, that of [1] necessary existence by causality, and [2] that of Creation by the desire and will of a Creator

Maimonides emphatically rejects [1] and supports [2]. Spinoza, who had access to the Keplerian hypothesis and therefore no longer saw the same deficiencies that Maimonides did in the Aristotelian system, asserted [1] in [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129) and denied [2] in [Ethics 1.17 sch](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#117sc). In doing so, he takes the opposite position to Maimonides while staying true to the latter's philosophical framework.

According to [Carlos Fraenkel](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9385-1_3) (in _Spinoza on Philosophy and Religion: The Averroistic Sources_, book chapter in _The Rationalists: Between Tradition and Innovation_) points out that the expression 'truth does not contradict truth' was used by Spinoza in _Cogitata Metaphysica_ (as 'veritas veritati non repugnat'). This phrase, of course, has a pedigree in Averroes' _Decisive Treatise_ where he uses it in the form (الحق لا يضاد الحق) _al-haqq la yuzad al-haq_. For Averroes, this statement is a lead-in to an allegorical interpretation of those parts of Scripture or religious tradition which contradict with philosophical truth. According to Fraenkel, Spinoza too held such a view at one point, although it seems very different from the position that Spinoza ultimately takes in the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_.
