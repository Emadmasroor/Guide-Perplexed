Harry A. Wolfson, _The Philosophy of Spinoza_ Vol.I Chapter 1 pg 20: 
> [His philosophy] has grown out of the very philosophy which he discards, and this by his relentless driving of its own internal criticism of itself to its ultimate logical conclusion.

Spinoza [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129): 
> Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.

Steven Nadler, _A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age_, Chapter 4 p.65:
> In the _Treatise_, Spinoza is deeply concerned to combat this notion of the prophet-philosopher [i.e., Maimonides' theory of prophecy]. One of the goals of the work is to secure the separation of the domains of religion and philosophy so that philosophers might be free to pursue secular wisdom unimpeded by ecclesiastic authority.

Steven Nadler, [_Why Spinoza Still Matters_](https://aeon.co/essays/at-a-time-of-zealotry-spinoza-matters-more-than-ever):
> Spinoza is often labelled a 'pantheist', but 'atheist' is a more appropriate term.

Steven Nadler, _A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age_, Chapter 3 p.50:
> Spinoza was always deeply offended by the accusation that he was an atheist, particularly if the charge meant, as his Voorburg opponents claimed, that he "mocks all religions." ... Spinoza writes, "Does that man, pray, renounce all religion who declares that God must be acknowledged as the highest good, and that he must be loved as such in a free spirit? And that in this alone does our supreme happiness and our highest freedom consist?"

Maimonides departs from Aristotle on the question of the eternity of the Universe, but this is related to (and perhaps anciliary to) the question whether the Universe is entirely governed by natural laws. In the Guide II.20, Maimonides [says](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_2.20.1?lang=en)
> For as it is impossible to reconcile two opposites, so it is impossible to reconcile the two theories, that of [1] necessary existence by causality, and [2] that of Creation by the desire and will of a Creator

Maimonides emphatically rejects [1] and supports [2]. Spinoza, who had access to the Keplerian hypothesis and therefore no longer saw the same deficiencies that Maimonides did in the Aristotelian system, asserted [1] in [Ethics I.29](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#129) and denied [2] in [Ethics 1.17 sch](https://www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=1#117sc). In doing so, he takes the opposite position to Maimonides while staying true to the latter's philosophical framework.

According to [Carlos Fraenkel](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9385-1_3) (in _Spinoza on Philosophy and Religion: The Averroistic Sources_, book chapter in _The Rationalists: Between Tradition and Innovation_) points out that the expression 'truth does not contradict truth' was used by Spinoza in _Cogitata Metaphysica_ (as 'veritas veritati non repugnat'). This phrase, of course, has a pedigree in Averroes' _Decisive Treatise_ where he uses it in the form (الحق لا يضاد الحق) _al-haqq la yuzad al-haq_. For Averroes, this statement is a lead-in to an allegorical interpretation of those parts of Scripture or religious tradition which contradict with philosophical truth. According to Fraenkel, Spinoza too held such a view at one point, although it seems very different from the position that Spinoza ultimately takes in the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_.

Fraenkel's argument is that Spinoza follows Averroes rather than Maimonides in his 'resolution' of the conflict between 'Jerusalem and Athens'. Averroes' position is that the inner, allegorical meaning is the 'true meaning' of Scripture, but this is not accessible to the multitude because it takes philosophical reasoning to understand, from first princriples, why one should lead a virtuous life. So, religion is a kind of 'short cut' to the virtuous life for the multitude. Fraenkel believes that "an Averroist would not attempt to resolve contradictions between philosophy and theology by composing an allegorical commentary on problematic passages in scripture as Maimonides did, for instance, with Biblical anthropomorphisms". (1) There is no need to do this because the multitude can continue to follow the literal meaning of Scripture with no harm to them, and (2) this could be dangerous because if people's belief in the literal sense of religion is destroyed, and if they do not have the philosophical capacity to arrive at correct opinions about how to live purely by way of reason, then they would be left with no guide. Fraenkel references Averroes' dictum that
> The philosopher is prohibited from intervening in the beliefs of popular religion even if they are philosophically as untenable as the anthropomorphic representation of God. ... [According to Averroes], philosophical doctrines may only be recorded in books that employ scientific demonstrations. For these, according to Averroes, are protected by their difficulty: books which “use demonstrations are accessible only to those who understand demonstrations” (Faṣl al-maqâl, 21). This, of course, is as true for Spinoza’s Ethics, 450 years later, as it is for Averroes’ commentaries on Aristotle.
