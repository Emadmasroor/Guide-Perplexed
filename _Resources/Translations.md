## Arabic Transliterations

### Huseyin Atay (1963 or 1974)
This is the only known transliteration of the _Guide_ into Arabic characters.

## English Translations

### Michael Friedlander (1881-85)
Friedlander's translation initially appeared in three volumes with footnotes. In a subsequent 1904 edition, the footnotes were eliminated and the book was combined into a single volume; this is the edition that is most commonly published, and the earlier edition has long been out of print.

This translation is no longer under copyright, and is available online.

### Chaim Rabin & Julius Guttmann (1952) [abridged]

### Shlomo Pines (1963)
Pines' translation is considered the definitive scholarly English translation. It attempts to be consistent in translating the same Arabic term with the same English term. However, it has been criticized for being unduly influenced by the Leo Strauss school of interpretation.

This translation is still under copyright.

### Lenn Goodman & Philip Lieberman (2024)

## Hebrew Translations

### Ibn Tibbon (1204)
This was the definitive Hebrew translation of the Guide, and indeed _the_ definitive version of the Guide for European Jews. Ibn Tibbon belonged to a family of scholars that lived in the south of France and who translated a large number of Arabic works into Hebrew. Samuel Ibn Tibbon can claim the distinction of being the only translator of the _Guide_ to have directly corresponded with Maimonides about how to translate the Guide.

In general, this translation has been described as hewing closely to the text, sacrificing 'sense' to word-to-word correspondence.

In 1981, Yehuda Even-Shmuel edited the Ibn Tibbon translation.

### Yehuda al-Harizi (1213)

### Yosef Qafih (1972)

### Michael Schwarz (1996-2002)
