    <p>This is a personal commentary on <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> (دلالة الحائرين  or מורה נבוכים), the philosophical magnum opus of Moses Maimonides written in the 12th century. It will take the form of chapter summaries with quotations from the original text, using the <a href="https://oll4.libertyfund.org/title/friedlaender-a-guide-for-the-perplexed" target="_blank">English translation</a> of Michael Friedländer. Phrases from the Arabic are taken from the publicly available <a href="http://sepehr.mohamadi.name/download/DelalatolHaerin.pdf" target="_blank">transliteration</a> by Hussein Attai.</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/writing/GP/intro">
      Introduction
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>The Introduction, which is formally part of ‘Part I’, is a striaghtforward account of Maimonides’ reasons for writing this book. Addressed to a promising young pupil, Maimonides states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The object of this treatise is to enlighten a religious man who has been trained to believe in the truth of our holy Law, who conscientiously fulfills his moral and religious duries, and at the same time has been successful in his philosophical studies. Human reason has attracted him to abide within its sphere; and he finds it difficult to accept as correct the teaching based on the literal interpretation of the Law … . Hence he is lost in perplexity and anxiety. If he be guided solely by reason, and renounce his previous views which are based on those [i.e., literal] expressions, he would consider that he had rejected the fundamental principles of the Law; and even if he retains the opinions which were derived from those expressions, and if, instead of following his reason, he abandon its guidance altogether, it would still appear that his religious convictions had suffered loss and injury.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage shows that Maimonides is concerned primarily with the relationship between ‘philosophy’ and the ‘Law’. He goes on to identify the expression <em>Ma’ase Bereshit</em> (account of the creation, from Genesis 1) with ‘Natural Science’, and the expression <em>Ma’aseh Mercabah</em> (description of the Chariot, from Ezekiel 1) with ‘Metaphysics’. At this stage, Maimonides reminds the reader of the Talmudic rule that ‘One may not expound … upon Genesis 1 in front of two students, and upon Ezekiel 1 in front of even one, unless he is wise and already understands it on his own.’ (Mishnah Hagiga 2:1)</p>

<p>Maimonides notes that certain passages in the Talmud (<em>Midrash</em>) “appear to be inconsistent with truth and common sense”, but that if</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>an ill-informed Theologian reads these <em>Midrashim</em>, he will find no difficulty; for possessing no knowledge of the properties of things, he will not reject statemtents which involved impossibilities. When, however, a person who is both religious and well educated reads them, he cannot escape the following dilemma: either he takes them literally, and questions the abilities of the author and the soundness of his mind…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maimonides states that the material to come has, in fact, been passed down the generations as part of the religious tradition of Judaism, and does not take credit for coming up with something entirely new. However, what <em>is</em> new is his effort to write these things down, an activity about which he is quite conflicted because of the Talmudic dictum to never discuss these subjects in front of lay people, and to take great care even when discussing them with specialized students. He says that the contents of this book include “topics which, since the time of our captivity have not been treated by any of our scholars as far as we possess their writings”.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/writing/GP/ch1/">
      Chapter 1
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>In chapter 1, Maimonides begins with a discussion of the phrase “Let us make man in our image” from Genesis 1:26, and writes about how the use of the word “image” (Arabic: صورة ; Hebrew: צלם) misleads people into thinking that the Bible describes a corporeal God. In other words, a literal reading of the Torah seems to suggest that God has a body with a face and limbs.</p>

<p>Maimonides is at pains to explain that this literal reading is wrong, not least because it denies the greatness of God. It is in this chapter that he sets out his tripartite skeleton for a theology that is consistent with the Law: that God exists, that he is One, and that he is Incorporeal. In fact, he insists, “there is no real unity without incorporeality”.</p>

<p>The words of the Bible must mean, of course, that man is “similar” to God for some meaning of the word “similar” (with apologies to the author for using a word he would undoubtedly have disapproved of). For Maimonides, the way in which man has been created “in God’s image” is by virtue of his ability to intellect (“إدراك الإنساني” or “إدراك العقلي”). This is what sets man apart from all other living things, and also accounts for why God said “نَعْمَلُ الانْسَانَ عَلَى صُورَتِنَا”.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/writing/GP/ch2/">
      Chapter 2
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>A questioner once asked Maimonides: How is it that the punishment for Adam’s sin (i.e., eating from the forbidden tree) resulted in the granting to mankind of that unique faculty which gives us precedence (فوقیت) over all other created beings, i.e. the ability to distinguish between good and evil?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… it thus appears strange that the punishment for rebelliousness should be the means of elevating man to a pinnacle of perfection to which he had not attained previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maimonides uses this question as a starting point to discuss several issues that are of great importance in the GP. His answer to the questioner is that Adam was endowed intellect before the Fall, and so he considers the question misguided at best.</p>

<p>Maimonides explains that when he speaks of intellect as mankind’s great distinction among all of creation, and the faculty which brings us in close connection with God, he is <em>not</em> referring to the faculty of distinguishing right (حسن) from wrong (قبيح) — i.e., morally ‘good’ vs. morally ‘bad’ — but to the faculty of distinguishing true (<em>haqq</em> حق) from false (<em>baatil</em> باطل). He explains the differences between these two axes of distinction by giving the example of the statements “the heavens are spherical” and “the earth is flat”. He says that it is not correct to say that these are “good” and “bad” statements, respectively, but that they are “true” and “false”.</p>

<p>In Maimonides’ account of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve already had “intellect”: they were endowed with the ability to distinguish the true from the false, but they did not (yet) possess any idea of “right” and “wrong”; not because they were deficient in some way, but for precisely the opposite reason. They had no reason to think that appearing in a state of nakedness is “bad” and that modesty is “good” because those categories did not make sense in that sublime state.</p>

<p>When Adam and Eve transgressed God’s commandment in the Garden, they were in a sense ‘punished’ by being given this additional faculty of distinguishing the “good” and the “bad”, categories that simply did not exist for them before this. For Maimonides, this is the reason why the fall of Adam is a “fall”, a demotion to a lower plane of existence. Because after the fall,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>he was wholly absorbed in the study of what is proper and what improper. Then he fully understood the magnitude of the loss he had sustained, what he had forfeited, and in what situation he was thereby placed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mankind, in its current fallen state, has no choice but to be embroiled in the perennial thorny questions of “apparent truths” (المشهورات) of the human sort as opposed to “necessary truths” (المعقولات) of the divine sort.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/writing/GP/ch3/">
      Chapter 3
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>This short chapter explains the apparent anthropomorphism in Numbers XII 8: “and the similitude (<em>tavnit</em> תבנית) of the Lord shall he behold”.</p>

<p>Considering the seemingly similar words الشكل (<em>shakl</em>) and الهيئة (<em>hai’at</em>), corresponding to the Hebrew words תמונה (<em>tmunah</em>) and תבנית (<em>tavnit</em>), Maimonides states that the word <em>hai’at</em> (هيئة) is never used in connection with God because the word refers to “the build and construction” of a thing. And the word <em>shakl</em> (شكل) , whose apparent meaning is the sense-perceptible form of an object, also admits (according to Maimonides) the meaning of ‘Form with a capital F’: “the true form of an object, which is perceived only by the intellect”. For Maimonides, this latter meaning is the only appropriate interpretation of Numbers XII 8.</p>

<p>The extant Arabic versions of Numbers XII:8 have the phrase “<em>wa shibha rabbi yu’ayin</em> وَشِبْهَ الرَّبِّ يُعَايِنُ” and do not use the word <em>shakl</em>. It seems that beholding the likeness, <em>shibha</em> (شِبْهَ), of God is much less theologically dangerous than beholding the form/face <em>shakl</em> (شكل) of God. It is possible that older Arabic versions of the Tanakh had <em>shakl</em> instead of the <em>shibha</em> that we see today.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/writing/GP/ch4-30/">
      Chapters 4 to 30 &amp; 37 to 45
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>Following from the models of chapters 1 and 3, most of the remaining chapters in part I are concerned with resolving the apparent anthropomorphisms in the Bible, or other verses which seem to point toward a corporeal God. For example, chapter 4 is concerned with the various places in the Bible where it seems as if someone “saw” God (e.g., Genesis XVIII 1, Exodus XXIV 10).</p>

<p>Maimonides is extremely thorough in his process of striking down every single anthropomorphism, and exhorts his readers not to confine themselves to those examples he treats explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When we treat in this work of any homonym, we do not desire you to confine yourself to that which is stated in that particular chapter; but we open for you a portal…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In chapter IX, Maimonides deals with Isaiah LXVI 1, “the heaven is my throne (<em>kursi</em> كرسي) \ and the earth is my foot-stool”. As may be expected, he is at pains to explain that the “throne” is a symbol for the power and dominion of God, and not to be taken literally, but he goes further.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… the throne denotes here the Essence and Greatness of God … these (Essence and Greatness) need not be considered as something separate from God himself or as part of the Creation, so that God would appear to have existed both without the throne and with the throne; such a belief would undoubdtedly be heretical (<em>haza kufr bila shak</em> هذا كفر بلا شك).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this passage we see the beginnings of Maimonides’ doctrine that God’s attributes are “inseparable from His Being” (جلالة و عظمة التي ليست شيئا خارجا عن ذاته…).</p>

<p>God does not stand, God does not sit, God does not rise, etc…</p>

<p>In chapter XVIII, Maimonides deals with verses such as Psalms CXLV 18 (“The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him”; الرب قريب لكل الذين يدعونه) and Exodus XXIV 2 (“And Moses alone shall come near the Lord”; ويقترب موسى وحده الى الرب) to examine the question about what it means to be “near” or “close to” God.</p>

<p>For Exodus XXIV 2, Maimonides offers two options: either one can inrepret the approach to be a ‘spiritual approach’, or one can interpret it to mean that Moses approached some physical place on the mountain. Guarding against any notion of God having a physical ‘place’ in this world, however, Maimonides is quick to add:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>provided you do not lose sight of the truth that there is no difference whether a person stand at the center of the earth or at the highest point of the ninth sphere, if this were possible; he is no further away from God in the one case, or nearer to Him in the other; those only approach Him who obtain a knowledge of Him; while those who reamin ignorant of Him recede from Him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, Maimonides <em>does</em> believe that there are degrees of closness and separation from God, but these degrees are strictly spiritual or intellectual, and the only axis along which we humans can approach God is along the axis of intellection. Moses, being the chief of the Prophets, came closest to achieving the <em>qurb</em> قرب of God, but this had nothing whatsoever to do with a spatial or physical nearness to God.</p>

<p>When speaking of the impossibility of God possessing motion in Chapter XXVI, Maimonides recalls the Talmudic saying that “The Torah speaks according to the language of man”, and remarks that since most people need tangible, material referrents with which to understand concepts, the Torah often uses figurative language to express the perfection of God; “whatever we regard as a state of perfection is attributed to God”. But according to Maimonides, “in relation to God, what we consdier to be state of perfection is in truth the highest degree of imperfection”. The argument here is that an ordinary person may associate lack of locomotion with ‘imperfection’, and for this reason the Torah, speaking in the language of man, hints at God possessing motion. However,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>it has been clearly proved that everything which moves is corporeal and divisible; it will be shown below that God is incorporeal and that He can have no locomotion; nor can reset be ascribed to Him, for rest can only be applied to that which also moves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, we see Maimonides working slowly but surely toward a decisive statement about God’s incorporeality, but he doesn’t get ahead of himself (“it will be shown below”), and is content with getting there piece by piece, one anthropomorphism at a time.</p>

<p>Later, in chapter XXVIII, he goes a step further and states</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>the incorpreality of God is a demonstrative truth and an indispensable element in our faith … the primary object of every intelligent person must be to deny the corporeality of God (<em>nafi altajsim ‘an Allah ta’aala</em> نفي التجسيم عن الله تعالى).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
    <a href="/writing/GP/ch31/">
      Chapters 31 &amp; 32
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>Maimonides argues that the intellectual faculties of man (<em>idraak al-‘aqli</em> إدراك العقلي) are subject to the same sorts of limitations that our physical faculties are subject to. This is so in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Just as, for example, one person’s eyesight may be better than another person’s, so one person’s capacity for intellectual perception/understanding may be better than another person’s. There is a variation in different members of the species’ ablity to understand and synthesize ideas.</li>
  <li>In addition, there are some limitations on the intellectual abilities of man <em>as a species</em>; these limitations cannot be surpassed by any member of the species, no matter how intellectually accomplished. “A boundary is undoubtedly set to the human mind which it cannot pass”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Amongst the things which it is <em>not possible for humans to know</em>, there are two types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>those which people do not really possess a desire to know. The paradigmatic example given by Maimonides is the question as to how many stars there are in the heavens and whether their number is even or odd. This is a question which is outside the reaches of human understanding, but no one really cares.</li>
  <li>those which people in all societies at all times have shown a desire to know, and have motivated extensive research, study, and debate. This category does <em>not</em> include those questions which can be answered by demonstrative evidence or logical reasoning, “for a proposition which can be proved by evidence is not subject to dispute, denial, or rejection”. According to Maimonides, uncertain questions of this type most commonly occur in Metaphysics, less commonly in Physics, and are “entirely absent from the exact sciences”.</li>
</ul>

<p>As preparation for the following chapters, Maimonides reminds the reader that there are four pitfalls to be aware of when investigating questions of the second type:</p>
<ol>
  <li>“arrogance and vainglory”</li>
  <li>“the subtlety, depth, and difficulty” of the subject</li>
  <li>“ignorance and want of capcacity to comprehend what might be comprehended”</li>
  <li>“habit and training”.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first three are attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_of_Aphrodisias" target="_blank">Alexander of Aphrodisias</a> and the fourth is added by Maimonides.</p>

<p>Chapter XXXII takes up a discussion about passages in Scripture which appear to circumscribe and limit the sphere of our pursuit of knowledge, e.g., Proverbs XXV 16. Maimonides believes that the appropriate interpretation of these passages is that one should</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>only attempt things which are within human perception; for the study of things which lie beyond man’s comprehension is extremeley injurious … It was not the object of the Prophets and our Sages in these utterances to close the gate of investigation entirely, and to prevent the mind from comprehending what is within its reach, as is imagined by simple and idle people…</p>
