    <p>The Introduction, which is formally part of ‘Part I’, is a striaghtforward account of Maimonides’ reasons for writing this book. Addressed to a promising young pupil, Maimonides states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The object of this treatise is to enlighten a religious man who has been trained to believe in the truth of our holy Law, who conscientiously fulfills his morla and religious duries, and at the same time has been successful in his philosophical studies. Human reason has attracted him to abide within its sphere; and he finds it difficult to accept as correct the teaching based on the literal interpretation of the Law … . Hence he is lost in perplexity and anxiety. If he be guided soltly by reason, and renounce his precious views which are based on those [i.e., literal] expressions, he would consider that he had rejected the fundamental principles of the Law; and even if he retains the opinions which were derived from those expressions, and if, instead of following his reason, he abandon its guidance altogether, it would still appear that his religious convictions had suffered loss and injury.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage shows that Maimonides is concerned primarily with the relationship between ‘philosophy’ and the ‘Law’. He goes on to identify the expression <em>Ma’ase Bereshit</em> (account of the creation, from Genesis 1) with ‘Natural Science’, and the expression <em>Ma’aseh Mercabah</em> (description of the Chariot, from Ezekiel 1) with ‘Metaphysics’. At this stage, Maimonides reminds the reader of the Talmudic rule that ‘One may not expound … upon Genesis 1 in front of two students, and upon Ezekiel 1 in front of even one, unless he is wise and already understands it on his own.’ (Mishnah Hagiga 2:1)</p>

<p>Maimonides notes that certain passages in the Talmud (<em>Midrash</em>) “appear to be inconsistent with truth and common sense”, but that if</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>an ill-informed Theologian reads these <em>Midrashim</em>, he will find no difficulty; for possessing no knowledge of the properties of things, he will not reject statemtents which involved impossibilities. When, however, a person who is both religious and well educated reads them, he cannot escape the following dilemma: either he takes them literally, and questions the abilities of the author and the soundness of his mind…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maimonides states that the material to come has, in fact, been passed down the generations as part of the religious tradition of Judaism, and does not take credit for coming up with something entirely new. However, what <em>is</em> new is his effort to write these things down, an activity about which he is quite conflicted because of the Talmudic dictum to never discuss these subjects in front of lay people, and to take great care even when discussing them with specialized students. He says that the contents of this book include “topics which, since the time of our captivity have not been treated by any of our scholars as far as we possess their writings”.</p>
