This is a website about a book written more than 800 years ago by an Iberian Jewish doctor in Fatimid/Ayubid Cairo, in classical Arabic using the Hebrew script.

# Introduction to the Guide 
This book begins with the following phrase
> This book [is] a key admitting to places the gates of which would otherwise be closed. When the gates are opened and men enter, their souls will enjoy repose, their eyes will be gratified, and their bodies will be eased of their toil and labour.

and ends with a quotation of the following Scriptural passages:
>  “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped” [(Isa. 35:5)](https://sefaria.org/Isaiah.35.5); “The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined” [(Isa. 9:1)](https://sefaria.org/Isaiah.9.1).

# Introduction to this website
This is a personal commentary on _Guide for the Perplexed_ (_dalalat al-haa'ireen_ دلالة الحائرين  or _moreh nebuchim_ מורה נבוכים), the philosophical magnum opus of Moses Maimonides written in the 12th century. It will take the form of [chapter summaries]({{site.baseurl}}/summaries) with quotations from the original text, using the [English translation](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed){:target="_blank"} of Michael Friedländer. Phrases from the Arabic are taken from the publicly available [transliteration](https://archive.org/details/DelalatolHaerin_201804){:target="_blank"} by Hussein Attai.

Each chapter summary is accompanied by a link to that chapter available on [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/), which is a website that provides easy access to a wide variety of Jewish religious texts. Most Old Testament quotations are also hyperlinked to the same website. At this point, Sefaria does not contain Shlomo Pines' translation, which is still under copyright.
